        "Solution 1": "We can solve this with some simple coordinate geometry. Let $A$ be the origin at let $AB$ be located on the positive $x-$axis. The equation of semi-circle $AB$ is $(x-13)^2+y^2=13^2, y \\geq 0.$ Since $E$ and $F$ are both perpendicular to $C$ and $D$ respectively, they must have the same $x -$ coordinate. Plugging in $1$ and $8$ into our semi-circle equation gives us $y=5$ and $y=12$ respectively. The distance formula on $(1, 5)$ and $(8, 12)$ gives us our answer of $\\sqrt{(1-8)^2 + (5-12)^2}=\\sqrt{2(7^2)}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 7\\sqrt{2}}.$\n\n\n"
