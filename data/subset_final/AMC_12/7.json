  "problem": "For positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that $m+10<n+1$, both the mean and the median of the set $\\{m, m+4, m+10, n+1, n+2, 2n\\}$ are equal to $n$. What is $m+n$?\n$\\textbf{(A)}20\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}21\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}22\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}23\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}24$",
  "solutions": {
    "Solution 1": "The mean and median are \\[\\frac{3m+4n+17}{6}=\\frac{m+n+11}{2}=n,\\]so $3m+17=2n$ and $m+11=n$. Solving this gives $\\left(m,n\\right)=\\left(5,16\\right)$ for $m+n=\\boxed{21}$.",
    "Solution 2": "This is an alternate solution if you don't want to solve using algebra. First, notice that the median $n$ is the average of $m+10$ and $n+1$. Therefore, $n=m+11$, so the answer is $m+n=2m+11$, which must be odd. This leaves two remaining options: ${(B) 21}$ and ${(D) 23}$. Notice that if the answer is $(B)$, then $m$ is odd, while $m$ is even if the answer is $(D)$. Since the average of the set is an integer $n$, the sum of the terms must be even. $4+10+1+2+2n$ is odd by definition, so we know that $3m+2n$ must also be odd, thus with a few simple calculations $m$ is odd. Because all other answers have been eliminated, $(B)$ is the only possibility left. Therefore, $m+n=\\boxed{21}$. ",
    "Solution 3": "Since the median is $n$, then $\\frac{m+10+n+1}{2} = n \\Rightarrow m+11 = n$, or $m= n-11$. Plug this in for $m$ values to get $\\frac{7n-16}{6} = n \\Rightarrow 7n-16 = 6n \\Rightarrow n= 16$. Plug it back in to get $m = 5$, thus $16 + 5 = \\boxed{21}$."
