    "problem": "The \\textit{tower function of twos} is defined recursively as follows: $T(1) = 2$ and $T(n + 1) = 2^{T(n)}$ for $n\\ge1$. Let $A = (T(2009))^{T(2009)}$ and $B = (T(2009))^A$. What is the largest integer $k$ for which \\[\\underbrace{\\log_2\\log_2\\log_2\\ldots\\log_2B}_{k\\text{ times}}\\] is defined?\n\n\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 2009\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 2010\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 2011\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 2012\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 2013$\n\n\n",

        "Solution (not a proof, but good enough for AMCs)": "Testing the first two (or three) positive integers instead of 2009, $k$ seems to always be 4 more. Put E and go on to tackle #25Â :)\n~ dolphin7\n\n\n",
        "Solution": "We just look at the last three logarithms for the moment, and use the fact that $\\log_2 T(k) = T(k - 1)$. We wish to find:\n\\begin{align*} \\log_2\\log_2\\log_2\\left({T(2009)^{\\left({T(2009)}^{T(2009)}\\right)}}\\right) &= \\log_2(T(2009)\\log_2(T(2009)\\log_2 T(2009)))\\\\ &= \\log_2(T(2009)\\log_2(T(2009)T(2008)))\\\\ &= \\log_2 \\{ T(2009) [ T(2008) + T(2007) ] \\} \\\\ \\end{align*}\n\n\n\n\nNow we realize that $T(n - 1)$ is much smaller than $T(n)$. So we approximate this, remembering we have rounded down, as:\n\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\[\\log_2(T(2009)) = T(2008)\\]\\end{center}\nWe have used $3$ logarithms so far. Applying $2007$ more to the left of our expression, we get $T(1) = 2$. Then we can apply the logarithm $2$ more times, until we get to $0$. So our answer is approximately $3 + 2007 + 2 = 2012$. But we rounded down, so that means that after $2012$ logarithms we get a number slightly greater than $0$, so we can apply logarithms one more time. We can be sure it is small enough so that the logarithm can only be applied $1$ more time since $2012 + 1 = 2013$ is the largest answer choice. So the answer is $\\mathbf{(E)}$.\n\n\nEDIT: Why use answer choices? @above solution should explain at the end WHY they can be sure.\n\n\n",
        "Alternative Solution": "Let $L_k(x)=\\log_2\\log_2...\\log_2(x)$ where there are $k$ $\\log_2$'s. $L_k(B)$ is defined iff (if and only if) $L_{k-1}(B) > 0$ iff $L_{k-2}(B) > 1$. Note $\\log_2 T(k) = T(k - 1)$, so $L_{k-2}(T(k-2))=1$. Thus, we seek the largest $k$ such that $B > T(k-2)$. Now note that\n\n\n$T(2009)^{T(2009)^{T(2009)}} > 2^{2^{T(2009)}} = T(2011)$\n\n\nso $k=2013$ satisfies the inequality. Since it is the largest choice, it is the answer.\n\n\n"
