  "problem": "Carlos took $70\\%$ of a whole pie. Maria took one third of the remainder. What portion of the whole pie was left?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 10\\%\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 15\\%\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 20\\%\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 30\\%\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 35\\%$",
  "solutions": {
    "Solution 1": "If Carlos took $70\\%$ of the pie, there must be $(100 - 70)\\% = 30\\%$ left. After Maria takes $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the remaining $30\\%, \\ 1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$ of the remaining $30\\%$ is left.\nTherefore, the answer is $30\\% \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 20\\%}.$",
    "Solution 2": "Like solution 1, it is clear that there is $30\\%$ of the pie remaining. Since Maria takes $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the remainder, she takes $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 30\\% = 10\\%,$ meaning that there is $30\\% - 10\\% = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 20\\%}$ left.",
    "Solution 3 (One Sentence)": "We have \\[\\left(100\\%-70\\%\\right)\\cdot\\left(1-\\frac13\\right)=30\\%\\cdot\\frac23=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 20\\%}\\] of the whole pie left."
