        "Solution 1": "If Carlos took $70\\%$ of the pie, there must be $(100 - 70)\\% = 30\\%$ left. After Maria takes $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the remaining $30\\%, \\ 1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$ of the remaining $30\\%$ is left.\n\n\nTherefore, the answer is $30\\% \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 20\\%}.$\n\n\n~Awesome2.1 (Solution)\n\n\n~quacker88 ($\\LaTeX$ Adjustments)\n\n\n",
        "Solution 2": "Like solution 1, it is clear that there is $30\\%$ of the pie remaining. Since Maria takes $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the remainder, she takes $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 30\\% = 10\\%,$ meaning that there is $30\\% - 10\\% = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 20\\%}$ left.\n\n\n~DBlack2021\n\n\n",
