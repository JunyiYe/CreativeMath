        "Solution 1": "First of all, notice that for any odd prime $p$, the largest prime that divides $p+1$ is no larger than $\\frac{p+1}{2}$, therefore eventually the factorization of $f_k(N)$ does not contain any prime larger than $3$. Also, note that $f_2(2^m) = f_1(3^{m-1})=2^{2m-4}$, when $m=4$ it stays the same but when $m\\geq 5$ it grows indefinitely. Therefore any number $N$ that is divisible by $2^5$ or any number $N$ such that $f_k(N)$ is divisible by $2^5$ makes the sequence $(f_1(N),f_2(N),f_3(N),\\dots )$ unbounded. There are $12$ multiples of $2^5$ within $400$. $2^4 5^2=400$ also works: $f_2(2^4 5^2) = f_1(3^4 \\cdot 2) = 2^6$.\n\n\nNow let's look at the other cases. Any first power of prime in a prime factorization will not contribute the unboundedness because $f_1(p^1)=(p+1)^0=1$. At least a square of prime is to contribute. So we test primes that are less than $\\sqrt{400}=20$:\n\n\n$f_1(3^4)=4^3=2^6$ works, therefore any number $\\leq 400$ that are divisible by $3^4$ works: there are $4$ of them.\n\n\n$3^3 \\cdot Q^2$ could also work if $Q^2$ satisfies $2~|~f_1(Q^2)$, but $3^3 \\cdot 5^2 > 400$.\n\n\n$f_1(5^3)=6^2 = 2^2 3^2$ does not work.\n\n\n$f_1(7^3)=8^2=2^6$ works. There are no other multiples of $7^3$ within $400$.\n\n\n$7^2 \\cdot Q^2$ could also work if $4~|~f_1(Q^2)$, but $7^2 \\cdot 3^2 > 400$ already.\n\n\nFor number that are only divisible by $p=11, 13, 17, 19$, they don't work because none of these primes are such that $p+1$ could be a multiple of $2^5$ nor a multiple of $3^4$.\n\n\nIn conclusion, there are $12+1+4+1=18$ number of $N$'s ... $\\framebox{D}$.\n\n\n",
        "Solution 2": "Say a number $n$ is $\\textit{boring}$ if the sequence $\\{f_k(n)\\}$ is bounded; otherwise $n$ is $\\textit{interesting}$. \n\n\nIt is clear that $n$ is interesting iff $f_1(n)$ is. For a prime, $p$, $f_1(p)=1$. Thus, for a prime, $p_k$, in the prime factorization of $n$; if $e_k=1$ then $f_1(n)=f_1(n/p_k)$, so $n$ is interesting iff $n/p_k$ is. Continuing in this manner, we can divide $n$ by all such primes $p_k$ for which $e_k=1$; and $n$ is interesting iff each of these resulting numbers are. Finally we will end up with a number  whose prime factorization  contains only exponents $\\ge 2$. Let $S$ be the set of such numbers. It suffices to find all interesting numbers in $S$; all other interesting numbers will be multiples of these. Note that  $f_1(n)\\mid f_1(kn)$ for all $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$; so by induction a multiple of an interesting number is also interesting.\n\n\nThe set $S$ contains either powers of primes $\\le 19$, or a product of two such powers.\n\n\nWe have $f_2(2^a)=f_1(3^{a-1}) = 2^{2(a-2)}$; since $2(a-2)> a$ iff $a\\ge 5$, so $2^5$ and its multiples are interesting; there are $12$ such.\n\n\nWe have $f_2(3^b)=f_1(2^{2(b-1)}) = 3^{2b-3}$; since $2b-3> b$ iff $b\\ge 4$, so $3^4$ and its multiples are interesting; there are $4$ such.\n\n\nAmong the remaining prime powers only $7^3 \\textbf{ is interesting}$ but it has no other multiples in $[400]$.\n\n\nWe are now left with numbers $n\\in S$ that are products of two prime powers, i.e $n=p^aq^b$, $a,b \\ge 2$.  \n\n\nWe have $f_2(2^a3^b)= 2^{2(a-2)}3^{2b-3}$, so a number of this form is interesting iff $a\\ge 5$ or $b\\ge 4$; they are already counted above.\n\n\nIf $5^2\\mid n$ then $n=2^2\\cdot 5^2$ or $2^3\\cdot 5^2$ or $3^2\\cdot 5^2$ (all boring) or $n=2^4\\cdot 5^2=400$, $\\textbf{which is interesting}$, but has no other multiples. \n\n\nIf $7^2\\mid n$ then $n$ is $2^2\\cdot 7^2$ or $2^3\\cdot 7^2$ and both are boring. \n\n\nNo larger prime can divide $n$ because even $11^2\\cdot 2^2 > 400$. \n\n\nWe have found all the interesting numbers: $12$ multiples of $2^5$, $4$ multiples of $3^4$, $2^4\\cdot 5^2$, and $7^3$ for a total of $12+4+1+1= 18$ ... $\\framebox{D}$.\n\n\n"
