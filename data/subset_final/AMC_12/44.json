  "problem": "In a triangle with integer side lengths, one side is three times as long as a second side, and the length of the third side is 15. What is the greatest possible perimeter of the triangle?\n$\\text {(A) } 43 \\qquad \\text {(B) } 44 \\qquad \\text {(C) } 45 \\qquad \\text {(D) } 46 \\qquad \\text {(E) } 47$",
  "solutions": {
    "Solution": "If the second size has length x, then the first side has length 3x, and we have the third side which has length 15. By the triangle inequality, we have: \\[\\\\ x+15>3x \\Rightarrow 2x<15 \\Rightarrow x<7.5\\] Now, since we want the greatest perimeter, we want the greatest integer x, and if $x<7.5$ then $x=7$. Then, the first side has length $3*7=21$, the second side has length $7$, the third side has length $15$, and so the perimeter is $21+7+15=43 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\text {(A)}}$."
