    "problem": "An ice-cream novelty item consists of a cup in the shape of a 4-inch-tall frustum of a right circular cone, with a 2-inch-diameter base at the bottom and a 4-inch-diameter base at the top, packed solid with ice cream, together with a solid cone of ice cream of height 4 inches, whose base, at the bottom, is the top base of the frustum. What is the total volume of the ice cream, in cubic inches?\n\n\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 8\\pi \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ \\frac{28\\pi}{3} \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 12\\pi \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 14\\pi \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\frac{44\\pi}{3}$\n\n\n",

        "Solution 1": "The top cone has radius 2 and height 4 so it has volume $\\dfrac{1}{3} \\pi (2)^2 \\times 4$. \n\n\nThe frustum is made up by taking away a small cone of radius 1, height 4 from a large cone of radius 2, height 8, so it has volume\n$\\dfrac{1}{3} \\pi (2)^2 \\times 8 - \\dfrac{1}{3} \\pi (1)^2 \\times 4$.\n\n\nAdding, we get $\\dfrac{1}{3} \\pi (16+32-4) = \\boxed{ \\textbf{E} \\ \\dfrac{44\\pi}{3}}$. \n\n\nSolution by: SilverLion \n\n\n",
        "Solution 2": "Find the volume of the cone with the method in Solution 1. The volume of the frustrum is $\\pi\\int_{0}^{4} \\left(-\\frac{1}{4}x+2\\right)^2 dx=\\frac{28\\pi}{3}$\n\n\nAdding, we get $\\dfrac{44\\pi}{3}$.\n\n\nSolution by IdentityChaos2020\n\n"
