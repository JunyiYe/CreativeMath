    "Solution 1": "We can guess that the series given by the problem is periodic in some way. Starting off, $u_0=4$ is given. $u_1=u_{0+1}=f(u_0)=f(4)=5,$ so $u_1=5.$ $u_2=u_{1+1}=f(u_1)=f(5)=2,$ so $u_2=2.$ $u_3=u_{2+1}=f(u_2)=f(2)=1,$ so $u_3=1.$ $u_4=u_{3+1}=f(u_3)=f(1)=4,$ so $u_4=4.$ Plugging in $4$ will give us $5$ as found before, and plugging in $5$ will give $2$ and so on. This means that our original guess of the series being periodic was correct. Summing up our findings in a nice table,\n\\[\\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|c|}  \\hline   n & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & ...\\\\   \\hline  un & 4 & 5 & 2 & 1 & 4 & ...\\\\  \\hline \\end{tabular}\\]\nin which the next $u_n$ is found by simply plugging in the number from the last box into $f(x).$ The function is periodic every $4$ terms. $2002 \\equiv 2\\pmod{4}$, and counting $4$ starting from $u_1$ will give us our answer of $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 2}$."
