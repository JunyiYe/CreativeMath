    "problem": "A traffic light runs repeatedly through the following cycle: green for $30$ seconds, then yellow for $3$ seconds, and then red for $30$ seconds. Leah picks a random three-second time interval to watch the light. What is the probability that the color changes while she is watching?\n\n\n$\\mathrm{(A)}\\ \\frac{1}{63} \\qquad \\mathrm{(B)}\\ \\frac{1}{21} \\qquad \\mathrm{(C)}\\ \\frac{1}{10} \\qquad \\mathrm{(D)}\\ \\frac{1}{7} \\qquad \\mathrm{(E)}\\ \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n\n",

        "Solution": "The traffic light runs through a $63$ second cycle.\n\n\nLetting $t=0$ reference the moment it turns green, the light changes at three different times: $t=30$, $t=33$, and $t=63$\n\n\nThis means that the light will change if the beginning of Leah's interval lies in\n$[27,30]$, $[30,33]$ or $[60,63]$\n\n\nThis gives a total of $9$ seconds out of $63$\n\n\n$\\frac{9}{63} = \\frac{1}{7} \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{(D)}$\n\n\n"
