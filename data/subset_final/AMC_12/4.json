  "problem": "Jamal wants to save 30 files onto disks, each with 1.44 MB space. 3 of the files take up 0.8 MB, 12 of the files take up 0.7 MB, and the rest take up 0.4 MB. It is not possible to split a file onto 2 different disks. What is the smallest number of disks needed to store all 30 files?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 12 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 13 \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 14 \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 15 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)} 16$",

    "Solution": "A $0.8$ MB file can either be on its own disk, or share it with a $0.4$ MB. Clearly it is better to pick the second possibility. Thus we will have $3$ disks, each with one $0.8$ MB file and one $0.4$ MB file.\nWe are left with $12$ files of $0.7$ MB each, and $12$ files of $0.4$ MB each. Their total size is $12\\cdot (0.7 + 0.4) = 13.2$ MB. The total capacity of $9$ disks is $9\\cdot 1.44 = 12.96$ MB, hence we need at least $10$ more disks. And we can easily verify that $10$ disks are indeed enough: six of them will carry two $0.7$ MB files each, and four will carry three $0.4$ MB files each.\nThus our answer is $3+10 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }13 }$.",
    "Solution 2": "Similarly to Solution 1, we see that there must be $3$ disks to account for the $0.8$ MB file. Secondly, since there are $[30-(3+12)]-3 = 12$ files(for both 0.4 MB and 0.7 MB) left, it is easy to see that the optimal way to place the files would be $3$ files per disks for the 0.4 MB files and hence would require 4 disks. \nWe are left with $12$ files($0.7$ MB), where the optimal number of files per disks is $2$, so the optimal number of disks for this type of file would be $6$ disks. Therefore, the answer is $3+4+6=\\boxed{13}$."
