    "problem": "Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be digits with $a\\ne 0$. The three-digit integer $abc$ lies one third of the way from the square of a positive integer to the square of the next larger integer. The integer $acb$ lies two thirds of the way between the same two squares.

        "Solution 1": "The difference between $acb$ and $abc$ is given by\n\n\n$(100a + 10c + b) - (100a + 10b + c) = 9(c-b)$\n\n\nThe difference between the two squares is three times this amount or\n\n\n$27(c-b)$\n\n\nThe difference between two consecutive squares is always an odd number, therefore $c-b$ is odd. We will show that $c-b$ must be 1. Otherwise we would be looking for two consecutive squares that are at least 81 apart. But already the equation $(x+1)^2-x^2 = 27\\cdot 3$ solves to $x=40$, and $40^2$ has more than three digits.\n\n\nThe consecutive squares with common difference $27$ are $13^2=169$ and $14^2=196$. One third of the way between them is $178$ and two thirds of the way is $187$.\n\n\nThis gives $a=1$, $b=7$, $c=8$.\n\n\n$a+b+c = 16 \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{(C)}$\n\n\n",
        "Solution 2": "One-third the distance from $x^2$ to $(x+1)^2$ is $\\frac{2x^2 + (x+1)^2}{3} = \\frac{3x^2+2x+1}{3}$.\n\n\nSince this must be an integer, $3x^2+2x+1$ is divisible by $3$. Since $3x^2$ is always divisible by $3$, $2x+1$ must be divisible by $3$. \n\n\nTherefore, x must be $10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25,$ or $28$. (1, 4, and 7 don't work because their squares are too small)\n\n\nGuessing and checking, we find that $x=13$ works, so the integer $abc$ is one-third of the way from $169$ to $196$, which is $178$. $1+7+8 = 16.$\n\n\n- JN5537\n\n\n",
        "Solution 3": "Let $k$ be the lesser of the two integers. Then the squares of the integers are $k^2$ and $k^2+2k+1$, and the distance between them is $2k+1$. Let this be equivalent to $3d$, so that the one-third of the distance between the squares is equivalent to $d$. The numbers $abc$ and $acb$ are one-third and two-thirds of the way between $k^2$ and $(k+1)^2$. Therefore, the distance between these two numbers is also one-third the distance between the squares, or $d$. Setting these equal to each other, we have\n\n\n\n\n$\\frac{2k+1}{3} = 9(c-b)$\n\n\n$\\Rightarrow 2k+1 = 27(c-b)$.\n\n\n\n\nNotice that since $c$ and $b$ are digits, their difference is at most $9$ and at least $0$. Also notice that since $acb$ is greater than $abc$, $c > b$. Representing this as an inequality, we have\n\n\n\n\n$27 \\le 27(c-b) \\le 243$.\n\n\n\n\nSubstituting $2k+1$, we have\n\n\n\n\n$27 \\le 2k+1 \\le 243$\n\n\n$\\Rightarrow 13 \\le k \\le 121$.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, we know that $abc$ is a $3$-digit number, and since $k^2$ is less than $abc$, $k^2$ must be at most $961$, or $31^2$. Therefore $k \\le 31$. Plugging this back into our inequality, we have\n\n\n\n\n$13 \\le k \\le 31$\n\n\n$\\Rightarrow 27 \\le 2k+1 \\le63$\n\n\n$\\Rightarrow 27 \\le 27(c-b) \\le 63$\n\n\n$\\Rightarrow 1 \\le (c-b) \\le \\frac{7}{3}$.\n\n\n\n\nBut (c-b) must be an integer, so now we have\n\n\n\n\n$1 \\le (c-b) \\le 2$\n\n\n$\\Rightarrow 27 \\le 27(c-b) \\le 54$\n\n\n$\\Rightarrow 27 \\le 2k+1 \\le 54$\n\n\n$\\Rightarrow 13 \\le k \\le\\frac{53}{2}$\n\n\n\n\n$k$ is also an integer, so now we have\n\n\n\n\n$\\Rightarrow 13 \\le k \\le 26$\n\n\n$\\Rightarrow 27 \\le 2k+1 \\le 53$\n\n\n$\\Rightarrow 27 \\le 27(c-b) \\le 53$\n\n\n$\\Rightarrow 1 \\le (c-b) \\le \\frac{53}{27}$.\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, $(c-b)$ must be an integer, so we have\n\n\n$1 \\le (c-b) \\le 1$\n\n\n$\\Rightarrow (c-b) = 1$\n\n\n$\\Rightarrow 27(c-b) = 27$\n\n\n$\\Rightarrow 2k+1 = 27$\n\n\n$\\Rightarrow k = 13$\n\n\n\n\nThe two squares are $13^2$ and $14^2$, or $169$ and $196$. A third of the distance between them is $9$, and $169 +9 = 178$. $1 + 7 + 8 = 16 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\text{C}}$.\n\n\n"
