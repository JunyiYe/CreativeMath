    "problem": "An organization has $30$ employees, $20$ of whom have a brand A computer while the other $10$ have a brand B computer. For security, the computers can only be connected to each other and only by cables. The cables can only connect a brand A computer to a brand B computer. Employees can communicate with each other if their computers are directly connected by a cable or by relaying messages through a series of connected computers. Initially, no computer is connected to any other. A technician arbitrarily selects one computer of each brand and installs a cable between them, provided there is not already a cable between that pair. The technician stops once every employee can communicate with each other. What is the maximum possible number of cables used?\n\n\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 190  \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\  191 \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\  192 \\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\  195 \\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 196$\n\n\n",

        "Solution": "We claim that to maximize the number of cables used, we isolate one computer and connect all cables for the remaining $29$ computers, then connect one more cable for the isolated computer.\n\n\nIf a brand A computer is isolated, then the technician can use at most $19\\cdot10+1=191$ cables. If a brand B computer is isolated instead, then the technician can use at most $20\\cdot9+1=181$ cables. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\  191}.$\n\n\n\\underline{\\textbf{Remark}}\n\n\nSuppose that the computers are labeled $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{20}$ and $B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_{10}.$ We will prove the claim in the first paragraph of this solution:\n\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\n\\item \\textbf{With exactly $\\boldsymbol{190}$ cables, it is possible that some computers cannot communicate with each other.}\n\nFrom this solution, it is clear that this claim is true: We isolate $A_{20}$ and connect all cables for $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{19}$ and $B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_{10}$ to get $19\\cdot10=190$ cables. However, $A_{20}$ cannot communicate with any of these $29$ computers. \n\n\n\n\n\\item \\textbf{With exactly $\\boldsymbol{191}$ cables, all computers must be able to communicate with each other.}\n\nBy the Pigeonhole Principle, we conclude that at least one brand B computer connects to all $20$ brand A computers. Without loss of generality, we assume that $B_1$ connects to all $20$ brand A computers. On the other hand, we conclude that at least $11$ brand A computer connects to all $10$ brand B computers. Without loss of generality, we assume that $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{11}$ connect to all $10$ brand B computers. \n\n\nTherefore, any two computers must be able to communicate with each other:\n\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\n\\item Between $A_i$ and $A_j,$ where $i,j\\in\\{1,2,\\ldots,20\\}$ and $i\\neq j$\n\nThe relay is $A_i\\leftrightarrow B_1\\leftrightarrow A_j.$ \n\n\n\n\n\\item Between $B_i$ and $B_j,$ where $i,j\\in\\{1,2,\\ldots,10\\}$ and $i\\neq j$\n\nThe relay is $B_i\\leftrightarrow \\{A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{11}\\}\\leftrightarrow B_j.$ \n\n\n\n\n\\item Between $A_i$ and $B_j,$ where $i\\in\\{1,2,\\ldots,20\\}$ and $j\\in\\{1,2,\\ldots,10\\}$\n\nThe relay is $A_i\\leftrightarrow B_1\\leftrightarrow \\{A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{11}\\}\\leftrightarrow B_j.$ \n\n\n\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n~MRENTHUSIASM\n\n\n"
