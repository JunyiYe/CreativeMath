How many points in the plane with positive $x$-coordinates lie on two or more of the graphs? \n\n\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 2\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 3\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 4\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 5\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 6$\n\n\n",

        "Solution": "Setting the first two equations equal to each other, $\\log_3 x = \\log_x 3$.\n\n\nSolving this, we get $\\left(3, 1\\right)$ and $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}, -1\\right)$.\n\n\nSimilarly with the last two equations, we get $\\left(3, -1\\right)$ and $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}, 1\\right)$.\n\n\nNow, by setting the first and third equations equal to each other, we get $\\left(1, 0\\right)$.\n\n\nPairing the first and fourth or second and third equations won't work because then $\\log x \\leq 0$.\n\n\nPairing the second and fourth equations will yield $x = 1$, but since you can't divide by $\\log 1 = 0$, it doesn't work.\n\n\nAfter trying all pairs, we have a total of $5$ solutions $\\rightarrow \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} 5}$\n\n\n",
        "Solution 2": "Note that $\\log_b a =\\log_c a / \\log_c b$.\n\n\nThen $\\log_b a = \\log_a a / \\log_a b = 1/ \\log_a b$\n\n\n$\\log_\\frac{1}{a} b = \\log_a \\frac{1}{a} / \\log_a b = -1/ \\log_a b$\n\n\n$\\log_\\frac{1}{b} a = -\\log_a b$\n\n\nTherefore, the system of equations can be simplified to:\n\n\n$y = t$\n\n\n$y = -t$\n\n\n$y = \\frac{1}{t}$\n\n\n$y = -\\frac{1}{t}$\n\n\nwhere $t = \\log_3 x$. Note that all values of $t$ correspond to exactly one positive $x$ value, so all $(t,y)$ intersections will correspond to exactly one $(x,y)$ intersection in the positive-x area.\n\n\nGraphing this system of functions will generate a total of $5$ solutions $\\rightarrow \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} 5}$\n\n\n"
