        "Solution 1": "\\textbf{(B)} Intuitively, $x$ will be largest for that option for which the value in the parentheses is smallest.\n\n\nFormally, first note that each of the values in parentheses is larger than $1$. Now, each of the options is of the form $3f(r)^x = 7$. This can be rewritten as $x\\log f(r) = \\log\\frac 73$. As $f(r)>1$, we have $\\log f(r)>0$. Thus $x$ is the largest for the option for which $\\log f(r)$ is smallest. And as $\\log f(r)$ is an increasing function, this is the option for which $f(r)$ is smallest.\n\n\nWe now get the following easier problem: Given that $0<r<3$, find the smallest value in the set $\\{ 1+r, 1+r/10, 1+2r, 1+\\sqrt r, 1+1/r\\}$.\n\n\nClearly $1+r/10$ is smaller than the first and the third option. \n\n\nWe have $r^2 < 10$, dividing both sides by $10r$ we get $r/10 < 1/r$. \n\n\nAnd finally, $r/100 < 1$, therefore $r^2/100 < r$, and as both sides are positive, we can take the square root and get $r/10 < \\sqrt r$.\n\n\nThus the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 3\\left(1+\\frac{r}{10}\\right)^x = 7}$.\n\n\n",
        "Solution 2": "As stated in the first solution, $x$ will be largest when the value in the parenthesis is smallest.\n\n\nWe can plug in a value for $r$ (for instance, $r=2$) and see which parenthesis has the smallest value. Doing so, we see that B is the answer.\n\n\n-Made_in_2004\n\n\n"
