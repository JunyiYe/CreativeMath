        "Solution": "Plugging into the quadratic formula, we get\n\\[x = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2} \\pm \\sqrt{8-4ac}}{2a}.\\]\nThe discriminant is equal to 0, so this simplifies to $x = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{2a}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{a}.$ Because we are given that $a$ is real, $x$ is always real, and the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}}.$\n\n\n~ cxsmi (significant edits)\n\n\n"
