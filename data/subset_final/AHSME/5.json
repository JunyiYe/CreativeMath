    "problem": "A sample consisting of five observations has an arithmetic mean of $10$ and a median of $12$. The smallest value that the range (largest observation minus smallest) can assume for such a sample is\n\n\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 2 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 3 \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 5 \\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 7 \\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 10$\n\n\n",
