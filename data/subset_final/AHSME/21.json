        "Solution": "Notice that if the vertex of a parabola is on the x-axis, then the x-coordinate of the vertex must be a solution to the quadratic. Since the quadratic is strictly increasing on either side of the vertex, the solution must have double multiplicity, or the quadratic is a perfect square trinomial. This means that for the vertex of $y = x^2 - 8x + c$ to be on the x-axis, the trinomial must be a perfect square, and have discriminant of zero. So,\n\n\n\\begin{align*}     0 &= b^2-4ac\\\\     0 &= (-8)^2-4c\\\\     c &=  64\\\\     c &= 16\\\\ \\end{align*}\n\n\nTherefore $c=16$, and our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}}$\n\n\n"
