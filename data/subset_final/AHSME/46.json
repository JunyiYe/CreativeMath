    "Solution": "Since this is a quartic equation, there are going to be $4$ solutions. \nBy Vieta's formulas, since the $x^3$ term is $0$, the sum of the roots is also $0$. Therefore, the 4th root of this polynomial is $-6$. \nLastly, by Vieta's Formulas, $a+c=-(1\\cdot2+1\\cdot3+1\\cdot-6+2\\cdot3+2\\cdot-6+3\\cdot-6)+1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot-6=-25-36=-61= \\fbox{D}$"
