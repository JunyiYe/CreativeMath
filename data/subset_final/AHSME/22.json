If $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive, then the entire thing amounts to $4$. If one of the three is negative and the other two positive, the answer is $0$. If two of the three is negative and one is positive, the answer is $0$. If all three are negative, the answer is $-4$. Therefore the set is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\{-4,0,4\\}}$.\n\n\nThis is very similar to https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2017_AMC_8_Problems/Problem_21\n\n\n"
