        "Solution 1": "By the law of cosines we can get the following expressions for $d^{2}$ and $b^{2}$:\n\n\n\\[d^{2}=2b^{2}(1-\\cos (100^\\circ))\\] \\[b^{2}=2a^{2}(1-\\cos (140^\\circ))\\]\n\n\nWe can substitute what we got for $b^2$ into the expression for $d^{2}$:\n\n\n\\[d^{2}=4a^{2}(1-\\cos (140^\\circ))(1-\\cos (100^\\circ))=4a^{2}(1-(\\cos (100^\\circ)+\\cos (140^\\circ))+\\cos (100^\\circ)\\cos (140^\\circ))\\]\n\n\nNow apply sum-to-product and product-to-sum identities:\n\\[d^{2}=4a^{2}(1-(2\\cos (120^\\circ)\\cos (120^\\circ))+\\frac{1}{2}(\\cos (240^\\circ)+\\cos (40^\\circ)))\\]\nSimplifying further gives us: \\[d^{2}=4a^{2}(1+\\cos (20^\\circ)-\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{2}\\cos (40^\\circ))\\]\nAfter using the fact that $\\cos (40^\\circ)=2\\cos^2 (20^\\circ)-1$, it's not hard to see that the expression in the parentheses is equal to $(\\cos (20^\\circ)+\\frac{1}{2})^{2}$. So we can square-root both sides to find the expression for $d$:\n\n\n\\[d=2a(\\cos (20^\\circ)+\\frac{1}{2})\\]\nNow let's look at the expression for $b^2$. We can apply the reverse of the double angle identity to show that $1-\\cos (140^\\circ)$ equals $2\\sin^2 (70^\\circ))$. So if we square root the entire expression we get that \\[b=2a\\sin (70^\\circ)=2a\\cos (20^\\circ)\\]\nWe now have everything in terms of $a$. Luckily when we consider choice $\\textbf{A}$ we can verify without much work that this must be the answer.\n\n\nSolution by harita19\n\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item NOTE: a much easier solution exists by drawing some lines and recognizing that the nonagon is cyclic, but for those of use who use algebra in every geometry problem, this is the best solution.\n\\end{itemize}\n",
        "Solution 2": "Using Van Schooten's Theorem, we draw an equilateral triangle in the nonagon, and immediately see that $a+b=d$.\n\n\n"
