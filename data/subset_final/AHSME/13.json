  "problem": "Cars A and B travel the same distance. Car A travels half that distance at $u$ miles per hour and half at $v$ miles per hour. Car B travels half the time at $u$ miles per hour and half at $v$ miles per hour. The average speed of Car A is $x$ miles per hour and that of Car B is $y$ miles per hour. Then we always have \n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ x \\leq y\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ x \\geq y \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ x=y \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ x<y\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ x>y$",

    "Solution": "Let $t$ be the total number of time in hours that Car B took to drive the distance.  This means that for have the time Car B traveled $\\tfrac{ut}{2}$ miles and for half the time Car B traveled $\\tfrac{vt}{2}$ miles.  That means the total distance traveled is $\\tfrac{ut+vt}{2}$ miles, so\n\\[y = \\frac{\\frac{ut+vt}{2}}{t}\\]\n\\[y = \\frac{u+v}{2}\\]\nBecause both cars traveled the same distance, for half the distance Car A took $\\tfrac{ut+vt}{4u}$ hours and for half the distance Car A took $\\tfrac{ut+vt}{4v}$ hours.  That means\n\\[x = \\frac{\\frac{ut+vt}{2}}{\\frac{ut+vt}{4u} + \\tfrac{ut+vt}{4v}}\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{u} + \\frac{1}{v}}\\]\nIn order to compare $x$ and $y$, we need to compare the values that $x$ and $y$ are equal to.\n\\[\\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{u} + \\frac{1}{v}} \\bigcirc \\frac{u+v}{2}\\]\nSince the denominators of both numbers are positive, cross-multiplying won\u2019t change the comparison sign.\n\\[4 \\bigcirc 2 + \\frac{u}{v} + \\frac{v}{u}\\]\n\\[2 \\bigcirc  \\frac{u}{v} + \\frac{v}{u}\\]\nBecause $uv$ is positive, the comparison sign does not need to be changed either.\n\\[2uv \\bigcirc u^2 + v^2\\]\n\\[0 \\bigcirc (u-v)^2\\]\nBy the , $0 \\le (u-v)^2$.  All of the steps are reversible, so $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ x \\leq y}$.  This can be confirmed by testing values of $u$ and $v$."
