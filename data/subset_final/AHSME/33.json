    "problem": "From a group of boys and girls, $15$ girls leave. There are then left two boys for each girl. After this $45$ boys leave. There are then $5$ girls for each boy. The number of girls in the beginning was:\n\n\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 40 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 43 \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 29 \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 50 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{None of these}$\n\n\n",

        "Solution": "Let us represent the number of boys $b$, and the number of girls $g$.\n\n\nFrom the first sentence, we get that $2(g-15)=b$.\n\n\nFrom the second sentence, we get $5(b-45)=g-15$.\n\n\nExpanding both equations and simplifying, we get $2g-30 = b$ and $5b = g+210$.\n\n\nSubstituting $b$ for $2g-30$, we get $5(2g-30)=g+210$. Solving for $g$, we get $g = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 40}$.\n\n\n"
