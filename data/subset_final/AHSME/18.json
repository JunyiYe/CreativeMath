    "problem": "The sum to infinity of the terms of an infinite geometric progression is $6$. The sum of the first two terms is $4\\frac{1}{2}$. The first term of the progression is:\n\n\n$\\textbf{(A) \\ }3 \\text{ or } 1\\frac{1}{2}  \\qquad \\textbf{(B) \\ }1 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) \\ }2\\frac{1}{2} \\qquad \\textbf{(D) \\ }6 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) \\ }9\\text{ or }3$\n\n\n",

        "Solution": "This geometric sequence can be written as $a+ar+ar^2+ar^3+\\cdots$. We are given that $a+ar=4\\frac{1}{2}$. Using the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, we know that $\\frac{a}{1-r}=6$. Solving for $r$ in the second equation, we find that $r=\\frac{6-a}{6}$. Plugging this into the first equation results in $a^2-12a+27=0$, which can be factored as $(a-3)(a-9)=0$. Hence, $a$ equals $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 9 \\text{ or }3}$.\n\n\n"
