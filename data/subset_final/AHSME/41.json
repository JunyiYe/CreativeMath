    "Solution": "Call the two roots $r$ and $s$, with $r \\ge s$. \nBy Vieta's formulas, $p=r+s$ and $(p^2-1)/4=rs.$\n(Multiplying both sides of the second equation by 4 gives $p^2-1=4rs$.)\nThe value we need to find, then, is $r-s$.\nSince $p=r+s$, $p^2=r^2+2rs+s^2$.\nSubtracting $p^2-1=4rs$ from both sides gives $1=r^2-2rs+s^2$.\nTaking square roots, $r-s=1 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}}$.\n(Another solution is to use the quadratic formula and see that the\nroots are $\\frac{p\\pm 1}2$, and their difference is 1.)"
