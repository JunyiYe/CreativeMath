        "Solution": "We are given that $f(x) +f(y) = f(x + y ) - xy - 1$ and $f( 1) = 1$, so we can let $y = 1$.  Thus we have:\n\n\n\\[f(x) + 1 = f(x + 1) - x - 1\\]\n\n\nRearranging gives a recursive formula for $f$:\n\n\n\\[f(x + 1) = f(x) + x + 2\\]\n\n\nWe notice that this is the recursive form for a quadratic, so f(x) must be of the form $ax^{2} + bx + c$.  To solve for $a, b,$ and $c$, we can first work backwards to solve for the values of f(0) and f(-1):\n\n\n\\[f(1) = f(0) + 0 + 2 \\Rightarrow 1 = f(0) + 2 \\Rightarrow f(0) = -1\\]\n\\[f(0) = f(-1)  -1 + 2 \\Rightarrow -1 = f(-1) + 1 \\Rightarrow f(-1) = -2\\]\n\n\nSince $f(0) = -1$:\n\\[f(0) = a(0)^{2} + b(0) + c = -1 \\Rightarrow c = -1\\]  \nSince $f(1) = 1$: \n\\[f(1) = a(1)^{2} + b(1)+ c = a + b - 1 = 1 \\Rightarrow a + b = 2\\] \nSimilarly, since $f(-1) = -2$:\n\\[f(-1) = a(-1)^{2} + b(-1)+ c = a - b - 1 = -2 \\Rightarrow a - b = -1\\]\n\n\nThus we have the system of equations:\n\n\n\\[a + b = 2\\]\n\\[a - b = -1\\]\n\n\nWhich can be solved to yield $a = \\frac{1}{2}$, $b = \\frac{3}{2}$.  Therefore, $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2} x^{2} + \\frac{3}{2} x - 1$.\n\n\nSince we are searching for values for which $f(x) = x$, we have the equation $\\frac{1}{2} x^{2} + \\frac{3}{2} x - 1 = x$.  Subtracting $x$ yields $\\frac{1}{2} x^{2} + \\frac{1}{2} x - 1 = 0$, which we can simplify by dividing both sides by $\\frac{1}{2}$: $x^{2} + x - 2 = 0$.  This factors into $(x + 2) (x - 1) = 0$, so therefore there are two solutions to $f(x) = x$: $-2$ and $1$.  Since the problem asks only for solutions that do not equal $1$, the answer is $\\fbox{(B) 1}$.\n\n\n"
