The graph of $y=|x|$ is the combined graphs of $y=x$ and $y=-x$ with a nonnegative y. Because the arguments of $y=x$ and $y=-x$ are $135^\\circ$ and $45^\\circ$ respectively, the angle between the graphs of $y=x$ and $y=-x$ is $90^\\circ$. Thus, the smallest region bounded by the graphs is $\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot2^2\\cdot\\pi = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } \\pi}$.\n\n\n"
