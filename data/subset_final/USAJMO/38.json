    "Solution 1": "We claim that $m$ satisfies the given conditions if and only if $m$ is a perfect square.\nTo begin, we let the common difference of $\\{a_n\\}$ be $d$ and the common ratio of $\\{g_n\\}$ be $r$. Then, rewriting the conditions modulo $m$ gives:\n\\[a_2-a_1=d\\not\\equiv 0\\pmod{m}\\text{         (1)}\\]\n\\[a_n\\equiv g_n\\pmod{m}\\text{             (2)}\\]\nCondition $(1)$ holds if no consecutive terms in $a_i$ are equivalent modulo $m$, which is the same thing as never having consecutive, equal, terms, in $a_i\\pmod{m}$. By Condition $(2)$, this is also the same as never having equal, consecutive, terms in $g_i\\pmod{m}$:\n\\[(1)\\iff g_l\\not\\equiv g_{l-1}\\pmod{m}\\text{ for any integer }l>1\\]\n\\[\\iff g_{l-1}(r-1)\\not\\equiv 0\\pmod{m}.\\text{        (3)}\\]\n\nAlso, Condition $(2)$ holds if\n\\[g_{l+1}-g_l\\equiv g_l-g_{l-1}\\pmod{m}\\]\n\\[g_{l-1}(r-1)^2\\equiv0\\pmod{m}\\text{        (4)}.\\]\nRestating, $(1),(2)\\quad \\textrm{if} \\quad(3),(4)$, and the conditions $g_{l-1}(r-1)\\not\\equiv 0\\pmod{m}$ and $g_{l-1}(r-1)^2\\equiv0\\pmod{m}$ hold if and only if $m$ is a perfect square.\n[will finish that step here]\nNote: This shouldn't work since we see that m = 12 is a solution. Let the initials for both series by 1, then let the ratio be 7 and the common difference to be 6. We see multiplying by 7 mod 12 that the geometric sequence is alternating from 1 to 7 to 1 to 7 and so on, which is the same as adding 6. Therefore, this solution is wrong. My counter-conjecture is that all non square-free m (4, 8, 9, 16, 18, 25...) should all work, but I don't have a proof. However, if you edit the one above, you can see non square-free m will work. In order to construct a ratio, we could us (4) and find a square multiple of m, take the square root and add 1 to get the ratio. Let $m = at^2$ then $at + 1 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{at^2}$ or $at$ is not divisble by $at^2$. If $t = 1$, this is false and this is not possible. But if it isn't, if $m$ isn't square free, then it should work."
