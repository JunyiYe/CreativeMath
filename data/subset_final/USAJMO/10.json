        "Solution 1": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. Let $m$ be the smallest positive integer with\n$m > n - m$.  Since $n > n - n = 0$, $m \\le n$. Let $N = \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$\nbe the set of positive integers from $1$ to $n$.  Let $M \\subset N$,\nbe $M = \\{1, \\ldots, m\\}$.\n\n\nLet $P_n$ be the set of of permutations of $N$.\n\n\nLet $C_m$ be the set of cyclic permutations of $M$, there are $m$\ncyclic permutations in all, and $C_m$ acts transitively on $M$, i.e.\nfor every pair of elements $a,b \\in M$, there is an element of $C_m$\nthat maps $a$ to $b$.\n\n\nLet $C'_m \\subset P_n$ be the permutations in $P_n$ that leave $N\\setminus M$\nfixed, and restricted to $M$ yield one of the permutations in $C_m$.\nThere is a natural one-to-one correspondence between $C'_m$ and $C_m$.\n\n\nWe claim that the $m$ permutations $C'_m$ intersect every permutation in\n$P_n$.\n\n\nSuppose, to the contrary, that there exists a permutation $p \\in P_n$\nthat does not intersect any permutation in $C'_m$. Since $C'_m$ acts\ntransitively on $M \\subset N$ the permutation $p$ cannot send any element of\n$M$ to any other element of $M$, therefore it must send all the\nelements of $M$ to $N\\setminus M$, but since $N\\setminus M$ has $n - m$ elements and $m > n - m$, this is impossible\nby the pigeonhole principle. Therefore such a permutation cannot\nexist, and the permutations in $C'_m$ intersect every permutation in\n$P_n$.\n\n\nFor $n = 2010$ we get $m = 1006$, which is the required special\ncase of the general result above.\n\n\n",
        "Solution 2": "I construct the following permutations by continuously rotating the first 1006 numbers):\n\n\n(1, 2, 3 ... 1005, 1006, 1007 ... 2009, 2010)\n\n\n(2, 3, 4 ... 1006, 1, 1007 ... 2009, 2010)\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n(1006, 1, 2 ... 1005, 1007, ... 2009, 2010)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI claim that these permutations above satisfy the property that any other permutation will intersect with at least one of them.\n\n\n\\textbf{Proof}:\nAssume for the sake of contradiction that there exists a permutation that won't intersect with these, say $(a_1, a_2, a_3 ... a_{2010})$.\n\n\n\\textbf{Lemma}:\nIf there exists a k such that $1 \\leq k \\leq 1006$ $a_k \\leq 1006$, we will get an intersection with the permutations. \n\n\nNote that for any 2 distinct permutations in our list, the numbers in kth index must be different, since each permutation is a rotation of an previous permutation. Also, the numbers can't exceed 1006, so, each number must occur exactly once in the kth index.\n\n\n\\textbf{End Lemma}\n\n\nUsing the lemma, in order to avoid intersections, we need $1007 \\leq a_k \\leq 2010$, for all $1 \\leq k \\leq 1006$.\n\n\nBut, there are 1004 numbers such that $1007 \\leq n \\leq 2010$, but we need to have 1004 numbers to fill in 1006 spots, and thus, by pigeonhole principle(the numbers are the holes, the spots are the pigeons), there must be 2 spots that have the same number! However, in a permutation, all numbers must be distinct, so we have a contradiction.\n\n\nSo, we have shown such a set of permutations exists satisfying that any permutation is guaranteed to intersect one of them, and the proof is complete. $\\blacksquare$\n\n\n-Alexlikemath\n\n\n"
