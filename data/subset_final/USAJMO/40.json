    "problem": "Two rational numbers $\\frac{m}{n}$ and $\\frac{n}{m}$ are written on a blackboard, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. At any point, Evan may pick two of the numbers $x$ and $y$ written on the board and write either their arithmetic mean $\\frac{x+y}{2}$ or their harmonic mean $\\frac{2xy}{x+y}$ on the board as well. Find all pairs $(m,n)$ such that Evan can write $1$ on the board in finitely many steps.\n\n\nProposed by Yannick Yao\n\n\n",

        "Solution": "We claim that all odd $m, n$ work if $m+n$ is a positive power of 2.\n\n\nProof:\nWe first prove that $m+n=2^k$ works. By weighted averages we have that $\\frac{n(\\frac{m}{n})+(2^k-n)\\frac{n}{m}}{2^k}=\\frac{m+n}{2^k}=1$ can be written, so the solution set does indeed work. We will now prove these are the only solutions.\n\n\nAssume that $m+n\\ne 2^k$, so then $m+n\\equiv 0\\pmod{p}$ for some odd prime $p$. Then $m\\equiv -n\\pmod{p}$, so $\\frac{m}{n}\\equiv \\frac{n}{m}\\equiv -1\\pmod{p}$. We see that the arithmetic mean is $\\frac{-1+(-1)}{2}\\equiv -1\\pmod{p}$ and the harmonic mean is $\\frac{2(-1)(-1)}{-1+(-1)}\\equiv -1\\pmod{p}$, so if 1 can be written then $1\\equiv -1\\pmod{p}$ and $2\\equiv 0\\pmod{p}$ which is obviously impossible, and we are done.\n\n\n-Stormersyle\n\n\n"
