  "problem": "A  is defined as any finite string of letters.  A word is a  if it reads the same backwards as forwards.  Let a sequence of words $W_0$, $W_1$, $W_2$, $\\dots$ be defined as follows: $W_0 = a$, $W_1 = b$, and for $n \\ge 2$, $W_n$ is the word formed by writing $W_{n - 2}$ followed by $W_{n - 1}$.  Prove that for any $n \\ge 1$, the word formed by writing $W_1$, $W_2$, $\\dots$, $W_n$ in succession is a palindrome.",

    "Solution": "Let $r$ be the reflection function on the set of words, namely $r(a_1\\dots a_n) = a_n \\dots a_1$ for all words $a_1 \\dots a_n$, $n\\ge 1$. Then the following property is evident (e.g. by mathematical induction):\n$r(w_1 \\dots w_k) = r(w_k) \\dots r(w_1)$, for any words $w_1, \\dots, w_k$, $k \\ge 1$.\nWe use mathematical induction to prove the statement of the problem. First, $W_1 = b$, $W_1W_2 = bab$, $W_1W_2W_3 = babbab$  are palindromes. Second, suppose $n\\ge 3$, and that the words $W_1 W_2 \\dots W_k$  ($k = 1$, $2$, $\\dots$, $n$) are all palindromes, i.e. $r(W_1W_2\\dots W_k) = W_1W_2\\dots W_k$. Now, consider the word $W_1 W_2 \\dots W_{n+1}$:\n\\[r(W_1 W_2 \\dots W_{n+1}) = r(W_{n+1}) r(W_1 W_2 \\dots W_{n-2}W_{n-1}W_n)\\]\n\\[= r(W_{n-1}W_n) W_1 W_2 \\dots W_{n-2} W_{n-1} W_n\\]\n\\[= r(W_{n-1}W_n) r(W_1 W_2 \\dots W_{n-2}) W_{n+1}\\]\n\\[= r(W_1 W_2 \\dots W_{n-2} W_{n-1}W_n) W_{n+1}\\]\n\\[= W_1W_2\\dots W_n W_{n+1}.\\]\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, the statement of the problem is proved."
