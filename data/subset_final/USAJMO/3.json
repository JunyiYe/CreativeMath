        "Solution": "Since any $2016$ elements are removed, suppose we remove the integers from $1$ to $2016$. Then the smallest possible sum of $2016$ of the remaining elements is \\[2017+2018+\\cdots + 4032 = 1008 \\cdot 6049 = 6097392\\]\nso clearly $N\\ge 6097392$. We will show that $N=6097392$ works.\n\n\n$\\vspace{0.2 in}$\n\n\n$\\{1,2\\cdots 6097392\\}$ contain the integers from $1$ to $6048$, so pair these numbers as follows:\n\n\n\\[1, 6048\\]\n\n\n\\[2, 6047\\]\n\n\n\\[3, 6046\\]\n\n\n\\[\\cdots\\]\n\n\n\\[3024, 3025\\]\n\n\nWhen we remove any $2016$ integers from the set $\\{1,2,\\cdots N\\}$, clearly we can remove numbers from at most $2016$ of the $3024$ pairs above, leaving at least $1008$ complete pairs. To get a sum of $N$, simply take these $1008$ pairs, all of which sum to $6049$. The sum of these $2016$ elements is $1008 \\cdot 6049 = 6097392$, as desired.\n\n\n$\\vspace{0.2 in}$\n\n\nWe have shown that $N$ must be at least $6097392$, and that this value is attainable. Therefore our answer is $\\boxed{6097392}$.\n\n\n\n\nThe problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America's American Mathematics Competitions. \n\n\n"
