  "problem": "Let $\\alpha$ be an irrational number with $0 < \\alpha < 1$, and draw a circle in the plane whose circumference has length 1.  Given any integer $n \\ge 3$, define a sequence of points $P_1$, $P_2$, $\\dots$, $P_n$ as follows.  First select any point $P_1$ on the circle, and for $2 \\le k \\le n$ define $P_k$ as the point on the circle for which the length of arc $P_{k - 1} P_k$ is $\\alpha$, when travelling counterclockwise around the circle from $P_{k - 1}$ to $P_k$.  Supose that $P_a$ and $P_b$ are the nearest adjacent points on either side of $P_n$.  Prove that $a + b \\le n$.",

    "Solution": "Use mathematical induction. For $n=3$ it is true because one point can't be closest to $P_3$ in both ways, and that $1+2\\le 3$. Suppose that for some $n$, the nearest adjacent points $P_a$ and $P_b$ on either side of $P_n$ satisfy  $a+b \\le n$. Then consider the nearest adjacent points $P_c$ and $P_d$ on either side of $P_{n+1}$. It is by the assumption of the nearness we can see that either $(c,d)=(a+1,b+1)$ still holds, or $P_1$ jumps into the interior of the arc $P_{a+1}P_{n}P_{b+1}$, so that $c$ or $d$ equals to $1$. Let's consider the following two cases.\n(i) Suppose $a+b=n$.\nSince the length of the arc $P_nP_a$ is $\\{(a-n)\\alpha\\}$ (where $\\{x\\}$ equals to $x$ subtracted by the greatest integer not exceeding $x$) and length of the arc $P_bP_n$ is $\\{(n-b)\\alpha\\} = \\{a\\alpha\\}$, we now consider a point $P_0$ which is defined by $P_1$ traveling clockwise on the circle such that the length of arc $P_0P_1$ is $\\alpha$. We claim that $P_0$ is in the interior of the arc $P_bP_nP_a$. Algebraically, it is equivalent to either $\\{0-n\\alpha\\} < \\{a\\alpha-n\\alpha\\}$ or $\\{n\\alpha -0 \\} < \\{n\\alpha - b\\alpha\\} = \\{a\\alpha\\}$.\nSuppose the latter fails, i.e. $\\{n\\alpha\\} \\ge \\{a\\alpha\\}$. Then suppose $n\\alpha = m_1 + r_1$ and $a\\alpha = m_2 + r_2$, where $m_1$, $m_2$ are integers and $0< r_2\\le r_1 <1$ ($r_2$ is not zero because $a\\alpha$ is irrational). We now have \n\\[\\{0-n\\alpha\\} = \\{-m_1-1 + (1 -r_1)\\}=1-r_1\\] and \\[\\{a\\alpha -n\\alpha\\} = \\{m_2-m_1-1 + (1+r_2-r_1)\\} = 1+r_2-r_1>1-r_1\\]\nTherefore $P_0$ is either closer to $P_n$ than $P_a$ on the $P_a$ side, or closer to $P_n$ than $P_b$ on the $P_b$ side. In other words, $P_1$ is the closest adjacent point of $P_{n+1}$ on the $P_{a+1}$ side, or the closest adjacent point of $P_{n+1}$ on the $P_{b+1}$ side. Hence $P_c$ or $P_d$ is $P_1$, therefore $c+d \\le n+1$.\n(ii) Suppose $a+b\\le n-1$\nThen either $c+d = (a+1)+(b+1) \\le n+1$ when $c=a+1$ and $d=b+1$, or $c+d \\le 1+n$ when one of $P_c$ or $P_d$ is $P_1$.\nIn either case, $c+d\\le n+1$ is true."
