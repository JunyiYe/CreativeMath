  "problem": "Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral satisfying $AD^2+BC^2=AB^2$. The diagonals of $ABCD$ intersect at $E$. Let $P$ be a point on side $\\overline{AB}$ satisfying $\\angle APD=\\angle BPC$. Show that line $PE$ bisects $\\overline{CD}$.",

    "Solution 1": "Let $PE \\cap DC = M$. Also, let $N$ be the midpoint of $AB$.\nNote that only one point $P$ satisfies the given angle condition. With this in mind, construct $P'$ with the following properties:\n$AP' \\cdot AB = AD^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad BP' \\cdot AB = CD^2$\nClaim: $P = P'$\nProof:\nThe conditions imply the similarities $ADP \\sim ABD$ and $BCP \\sim BAC$ whence $\\measuredangle APD = \\measuredangle BDA = \\measuredangle BCA = \\measuredangle CPB$ as desired. $\\square$\nClaim: $PE$ is a symmedian in $AEB$\nProof:\nWe have \n\\[AP \\cdot AB = AD^2 \\iff AB^2 \\cdot AP = AD^2 \\cdot AB\\]\n\\[\\iff \\left( \\frac{AB}{AD} \\right)^2 = \\frac{AB}{AP}\\]\n\\[\\iff \\left( \\frac{AB}{AD} \\right)^2 - 1 = \\frac{AB}{AP} - 1\\]\n\\[\\iff \\frac{AB^2 - AD^2}{AD^2} = \\frac{BP}{AP}\\]\n\\[\\iff \\left(\\frac{BC}{AD} \\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{BE}{AE} \\right)^2 = \\frac{BP}{AP}\\]\nas desired. $\\blacksquare$\nSince $P$ is the isogonal conjugate of $N$, $\\measuredangle PEA = \\measuredangle MEC = \\measuredangle BEN$. However $\\measuredangle MEC = \\measuredangle BEN$ implies that $M$ is the midpoint of $CD$ from similar triangles, so we are done. $",
    "Solution 2": "By monotonicity, we can see that the point $P$ is unique. Therefore, if we find another point $P'$ with all the same properties as $P$, then $P = P'$\nPart 1) Let $N$ be a point on $\\overline{AB}$ such that $AN\\cdot AB = AD^2$, and $BN \\cdot AB = BC^2$. Obviously $N$ exists because adding the two equations gives $AN\\cdot AB + BN \\cdot AB = AD^2 + BC^2 = AB^2$, which is the problem statement. Notice that converse PoP gives\\[AN\\cdot AB = AD^2 \\implies \\bigtriangleup ADN \\sim \\bigtriangleup ABD\\]\\[BN\\cdot AB = AD^2 \\implies \\bigtriangleup CBN \\sim \\bigtriangleup ABC\\]Therefore, $\\angle AND = \\angle ADB = \\angle ACB = \\angle CNB$, so $N$ does indeed satisfy all the conditions $P$ does, so $N = P$. Hence, $\\bigtriangleup ADP \\sim \\bigtriangleup ABD$ and $\\bigtriangleup CBP \\sim\\bigtriangleup ABC$.\nPart 2) Define $G$ as the midpoint of $CD$. Furthermore, create a point $X$ such that $DX || EC$ and $CX || ED$. Obviously $XCED$ must be a parallelogram. Now we set up for Jacobi's. The problem already gives us that $\\angle APD = \\angle CPB$, which is good for starters. Furthermore, $\\bigtriangleup ADP \\sim \\bigtriangleup ABD$ tells us that\\[\\angle ADP = \\angle ABD = \\angle ACD = \\angle XDC\\]This gives us our second needed angle equivalence. Lastly, $\\bigtriangleup CBP \\sim\\bigtriangleup ABC$ will give\\[\\angle BCP = \\angle BAC = \\angle BDC = \\angle XCD\\]which is our last necessary angle equivalence to apply Jacobi's. Finally, applying Jacobi's tells us that $AC$, $BD$, and $XP$ are concurrent $\\implies$ $X$, $E$, $P$ collinear. Additionally, since parallelogram diagonals bisect each other, $X$, $G$, and $E$ are collinear, so finally we obtain that $P$, $E$, and $G$ are collinear, as desired."
