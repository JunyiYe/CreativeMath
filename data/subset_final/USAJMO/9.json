    "problem": "Given a triangle $ABC$, let $P$ and $Q$ be points on segments $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{AC}$, respectively, such that $AP = AQ$.  Let $S$ and $R$ be distinct points on segment $\\overline{BC}$ such that $S$ lies between $B$ and $R$, $\\angle{BPS} = \\angle{PRS}$, and $\\angle{CQR} = \\angle{QSR}$.  Prove that $P$, $Q$, $R$, $S$ are concyclic (in other words, these four points lie on a circle).\n\n\n",

        "Solution": "Since $\\angle BPS = \\angle PRS$, the circumcircle of triangle $PRS$ is tangent to $AB$ at $P$.  Similarly, since $\\angle CQR = \\angle QSR$, the circumcircle of triangle $QRS$ is tangent to $AC$ at $Q$.\n\n\n[asy] import markers;  unitsize(0.5 cm);  pair A, B, C, O, P, Q, R, S;  A = (2,12); B = (0,0); C = (14,0); P = intersectionpoint(A--B,Circle(A,8)); Q = intersectionpoint(A--C,Circle(A,8)); O = extension(P, P + rotate(90)*(A - P), Q, Q + rotate(90)*(A - Q)); S = intersectionpoint(B--C,arc(O, abs(O - P), 180, 270)); R = intersectionpoint(B--C,arc(O, abs(O - P), 270, 360));  draw(A--B--C--cycle); draw(Circle(O, abs(O - P))); draw(S--P--R); draw(S--Q--R);  label(\"$A$\", A, N); label(\"$B$\", B, SW); label(\"$C$\", C, SE); label(\"$P$\", P, W); label(\"$Q$\", Q, NE); label(\"$R$\", R, SE); label(\"$S$\", S, SW);  markangle(1, B, P, S, radius=4mm, marker(markinterval(stickframe(n=1,2mm),true))); markangle(1, P, R, S, radius=4mm, marker(markinterval(stickframe(n=1,2mm),true))); markangle(1, R, Q, C, radius=4mm, marker(markinterval(stickframe(n=2,2mm),true))); markangle(1, R, S, Q, radius=4mm, marker(markinterval(stickframe(n=2,2mm),true))); [/asy]\n\n\nFor the sake of contradiction, suppose that the circumcircles of triangles $PRS$ and $QRS$ are not the same circle.  Since $AP = AQ$, $AP^2 = AQ^2$, so the power of A with respect to both circumcircles is the same. Thus, $A$ lies on the radical axis of both circles.  However, both circles pass through $R$ and $S$, so the radical axis of both circles is $RS$.  Hence, $A$ lies on $RS$, which is a contradiction.\n\n\nTherefore, the two circumcircles are the same circle.  In other words, $P$, $Q$, $R$, and $S$ all lie on the same circle.\n\n\n",
        "Solution 2": "Note that (as in the first solution) the circumcircle of triangle $PRS$ is tangent to $AB$ at $P$.  Similarly, since $\\angle CQR = \\angle QSR$, the circumcircle of triangle $QRS$ is tangent to $AC$ at $Q$.\n\n\nNow, suppose these circumcircles are not the same circle. They already intersect at $R$ and $S$, so they cannot intersect anymore. Thus, AS must touch the two circumcircles at points $M$ and $N$, with $M$ on the circumcircle of triangle $PRS$. By Power of a Point, $AQ^2 = AM \\cdot AS$ and $AP^2 = AN \\cdot AS$. Hence, because $AP = AQ$, $AM = AN$, a contradiction because then, as they lie on the same line segment, M and N must be the same point! (Note line segment, not line.) Hence, the two circumcircles are the same circle.\n\n\n"
