    "problem": "Let $f(n)$ be the number of ways to write $n$ as a sum of powers of $2$, where we keep track of the order of the summation.  For example, $f(4)=6$ because $4$ can be written as $4$, $2+2$, $2+1+1$, $1+2+1$, $1+1+2$, and $1+1+1+1$.  Find the smallest $n$ greater than $2013$ for which $f(n)$ is odd.\n\n\n",

        "Solution": "First of all, note that $f(n)$ = $\\sum_{i=0}^{k} f(n-2^{i})$ where $k$ is the largest integer such that $2^k \\le n$.  We let $f(0) = 1$ for convenience.  \n\n\nFrom here, we proceed by induction, with our claim being that the only $n$ such that $f(n)$ is odd are $n$ representable of the form $2^{a} - 1, a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n\nWe induct on $a$.  It is trivially true for $a = 0$ and $a = 1$.  From here, we show that, if the only numbers $n \\le 2^{a-1} - 1$ where $f(n)$ is odd are of the form described above, then the only numbers $n \\le 2^{a} -1$ that are odd are of that form.  We first consider all numbers $b$, such that $2^{a-1} \\le b \\le 2^{a} - 2$, going from the lower bound to the upper bound (a mini induction, you might say).  We know that $f(b) = \\sum_{i=0}^{a-1} f(b-2^{i})$.  For a number in this summation to be odd, $b - 2^i = 2^m -1 \\rightarrow b = 2^i + 2^m - 1$.  However, we know that $b > 2^{a-1}$, so $m$ must be equal to $a-1$, or else $b$ cannot be in that interval.  Now, from this, we know that $i < a-1$, as $b<2^{a} - 1$.  Therefore, $i$ and $m$ are distinct, and thus $f(b - 2^i)$ and $f(b- 2^{a-1})$ are odd; since there are just two odd numbers, the ending sum for any $b$ is even.  Finally, considering $2^{a} - 1$, the only odd number is $f(2^{a} - 1 - 2^{a-1})$, so the ending sum is odd.  $\\Box$\n\n\nThe smallest $n$ greater than $2013$ expressible as $2^d - 1, d \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is $2^{11} -1 = \\boxed{2047}$\n\n\n",
        "Solution with Explanations": "Of course, as with any number theory problem, use actual numbers to start, not variables! By plotting out the first few sums (do it!) and looking for patterns, we observe that $f(n)=\\sum_{\\textrm{power}=0}^{\\textrm{pow}_{\\textrm{larg}}} f(n-2^{\\textrm{power}})$, where $\\textrm{pow}_{\\textrm{larg}}$ represents the largest power of $2$ that is smaller than $n$. I will call this sum the Divine Sign, or DS.\n\n\nBut wait a minute... we are trying to determine odd/even of $f(n)$. Why not call all the evens 0 and odds 1, basically using mod 2? Sounds so simple. Draw a small table for the values: as $n$ goes up from $0$, you get: $1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0...$. We have to set $f(0)=1$ for this to work. Already it looks like $f(n)$ is only odd if $n=2^{\\textrm{power}}-1$.\n\n\nThe only tool here is induction. The base case is clearly established. Then let's assume we successfully made our claim up to $2^n-1$. We need to visit numbers from $2^n$ to $2^{n+1}-1$. Realize that $2^n$ has $0$ for $f$ because there will be two numbers in DS that give a $f$ of one: $2^{n-1}$ and $1$. \n\n\nBut to look at whether a value of $f(\\textrm{number})$ is 1 or 0, we need to revisit our first equation. We can answer this rather natural question: When will a number to be inducted upon, say $2^n+k$, ever have a 1 as $f(\\textrm{number})$ in the DS equation? Well- because by our assumption of the claim up to $2^n-1$, we know that the only way for that to happen is if $2^n+k-2^{\\textrm{power}}$ in the DS is equal to $2^{\\textrm{Some power}} - 1$. Clearly $1 \\leq k \\leq 2^n - 1$.\n\n\nFinally, we can simplify. Using our last equation, $2^n+k-2^{\\textrm{power}}=2^{\\textrm{Some power}}-1$, regrouping gives $2^n+k=2^{\\textrm{power}}+2^{\\textrm{Some power}}-1$. \n\n\nMost importantly, realize that $\\textrm{power}$ can be from $0$ to $n$, because of the restraints on $k$ mentioned earlier. Same with $\\textrm{Some power}$. Immediately at least one of $\\textrm{power}$ and $\\textrm{Some power}$ has to be $n$. If both were smaller, LHS is greater, contradiction. If both were greater, RHS is greater, contradiction.\n\n\nTherefore, by setting one of $\\textrm{power}$ or $\\textrm{Some power}$ to $n$, we realize $k=2^{\\textrm{A certain power}}-1$.\n\n\nThe conclusion is clear, right? Each $k$ from $1$ to $2^{n-1}-1$ yields two distinct cases: one of $\\textrm{power}$ and $\\textrm{Some power}$ is equal to $n$, while the other is LESS THAN $n$. But for $k=2^n-1$, there is ONE CASE: BOTH values have to equal $n$. Therefore, the only $k$ that has $f(2^n+k)$ as odd must only be $2^n-1$, because the other ones yield a $f$ of 1+1=0 in our mod. That proves our induction for a new power of 2, namely $n+1$, meaning that $f(\\textrm{number})$ is only odd if $\\textrm{number} = 2^{\\textrm{Power of two}} - 1$, and we are almost done...\n\n\nThus, the answer is $2^{11}-1=\\boxed{2047}$.\n\n\nThis was pretty intuitive, and realizing quite $elementary$ steps about how powers of 2 work gave us the solution!
