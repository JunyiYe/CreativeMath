        "Solution": "Let digit $1$ of a number be the units digit, digit $2$ be the tens digit, and so on. Let the 6 consecutive zeroes be at digits $k-5$ through digit $k$. The criterion is then obviously equivalent to \n\n\n\\[5^n \\bmod 10^k < 10^{k-6}\\]\n\n\nWe will prove that $n = 20+2^{19}, k = 20$ satisfies this, thus proving the problem statement (since $n = 20+2^{19} < 10^6$). \n\n\nWe want \n\n\n\\[5^{20+2^{19}}\\pmod{10^{20}}\\]\n\n\nWe can split this into its prime factors. Obviously, it is a multiple of $5^{20}$, so we only need to consider it $\\mod2^{20}$.\n\n\n\\[5^{20}\\cdot5^{2^{19}}\\pmod{2^{20}}\\]\n\n\n\\[5^{20}\\cdot5^{\\varphi(2^{20})}\\pmod{2^{20}}\\]\n\n\n($\\varphi$ is the Euler Totient Function.)

        "Motivation for Solution": "Modifying our necessary and sufficient inequality, we get:\n\n\n\\[5^n \\mod 10^k < 10^{k-6}\\]\n\n\n\\[5^k \\left(5^{n-k} \\mod 2^k\\right) < 10^{k-6}\\]\n\n\n\\[5^{n-k} \\mod 2^k < \\frac{2^{k-6}}{5^6}\\]\n\n\nSince gcd$\\left(5^{n-k}, 2^k\\right) = 1$ if $k \\neq 0$ (which is obviously true) and $n \\neq k$ which is also true given that $5^k < 10^k$, we need the RHS to be greater than $1$:\n\n\n\\[\\frac{2^{k-6}}{5^6} > 1\\]\n\n\n\\[2^{k-6} > 5^6\\]\n\n\n\\[2^k > 10^6\\]\n\n\nThe first $k$ that satisfies this inequality is $k = 20$, so we let $k = 20$:\n\n\n\\[5^{n-20} \\mod 2^{20} < \\frac{2^{14}}{5^6}\\]\n\n\n\\[5^{n-20} \\mod 2^{20} \\leq 1\\]\n\n\n\\[5^{n-20} \\mod 2^{20} = 1\\]\n\n\nFrom this, Euler's Theorem comes to mind and we see that if $n-20 = \\varphi\\left(2^{20}\\right)$, the equality is satisfied. Thus, we get that $n = 20 + 2^{19}$, which is less than $10^6$, and we should be done. However, this requires slightly more formalization, and can be proven directly more easily if $n = 20+2^{19}$ is known or suspected. \n\n\nThe problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America's American Mathematics Competitions. \n\n\n"
