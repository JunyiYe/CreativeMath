    "Solution with Thought Process": "Without loss of generality, let $1 \\le x \\le y \\le z$. Then $\\sqrt{x + xyz} = \\sqrt{x - 1} + \\sqrt{y - 1} + \\sqrt{z - 1}$.\nSuppose x = y = z. Then $\\sqrt{x + x^3} = 3\\sqrt{x-1}$, so $x + x^3 = 9x - 9$. It is easily verified that $x^3 - 8x + 9 = 0$ has no solution in positive numbers greater than 1. Thus, $\\sqrt{x + xyz} \\ge \\sqrt{x - 1} + \\sqrt{y - 1} + \\sqrt{z - 1}$ for x = y = z. We suspect if the inequality always holds.\nLet x = 1. Then we have $\\sqrt{1 + yz} \\ge \\sqrt{y-1} + \\sqrt{z-1}$, which simplifies to \\[1 + yz \\ge y + z - 2 + 2\\sqrt{(y-1)(z-1)}\\] and hence \\[yz - y - z + 3 \\ge 2\\sqrt{(y-1)(z-1)}\\] Let us try a few examples: if y = z = 2, we have $3 > 2$; if y = z, we have $y^2 - 2y + 3 \\ge 2(y-1)$, which reduces to $y^2 - 4y + 5 \\ge 0$. The discriminant (16 - 20) is negative, so in fact the inequality is strict. Now notice that yz - y - z + 3 = (y-1)(z-1) + 2. Now we see we can let $u = \\sqrt{(y-1)(z-1)}$! Thus, \\[u^2 - 2u + 2 = (u-1)^2 + 1 > 0\\] and the claim holds for x = 1.\nIf x > 1, we see the $\\sqrt{x - 1}$ will provide a huge obstacle when squaring. But, using the identity $(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + xy + yz + xz$:\n\\[x + xyz \\ge x - 1 + y - 1 + z - 1 + 2\\sqrt{(x-1)(y-1)} + 2\\sqrt{(y-1)(z-1)} + 2\\sqrt{(x-1)(y-1)}\\]\nwhich leads to\n\\[xyz \\ge y + z - 3 + 2\\sqrt{(x-1)(y-1)} + 2\\sqrt{(y-1)(z-1)} + 2\\sqrt{(x-1)(z-1)}\\]\nAgain, we experiment. If x = 2, y = 3, and z = 3, then $18 > 7 + 4\\sqrt{6}$.\nNow, we see the finish: setting $u = \\sqrt{x-1}$ gives $x = u^2 + 1$. We can solve a quadratic in u! Because this problem is a #6, the crown jewel of USAJMO problems, we do not hesitate in computing the messy computations:\n\\[u^2(yz) - u(2\\sqrt{y-1} + 2\\sqrt{z-1}) + (3 + yz - y - z - 2\\sqrt{(y-1)(z-1)}) \\ge 0\\]\nBecause the coefficient of $u^2$ is positive, all we need to do is to verify that the discriminant is nonpositive:\n\\[b^2 - 4ac = 4(y-1) + 4(z-1) - 8\\sqrt{(y-1)(z-1)} - yz(12 + 4yz - 4y - 4z - 8\\sqrt{(y-1)(z-1)})\\]\nLet us try a few examples. If y = z, then the discriminant D = $8(y-1) - 8(y-1) - yz(12 + 4y^2 - 8y - 8(y-1)) = -yz(4y^2 - 16y + 20) = -4yz(y^2 - 4y + 5) < 0$.\nWe are almost done, but we need to find the correct argument. (How frustrating!)\nSuccess! The discriminant is negative. Thus, we can replace our claim with a strict one, and there are no real solutions to the original equation in the hypothesis."
