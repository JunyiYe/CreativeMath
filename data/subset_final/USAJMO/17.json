  "problem": "Consider the assertion that for each positive integer $n \\ge 2$, the remainder upon dividing $2^{2^n}$ by $2^n-1$ is a power of 4. Either prove the assertion or find (with proof) a counter-example.",
  "solutions": {
    "Solution": "We will show that $n = 25$ is a counter-example.\nSince $\\textstyle 2^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n - 1}$, we see that for any integer $k$, $\\textstyle 2^{2^n} \\equiv 2^{(2^n - kn)} \\pmod{2^n-1}$. Let $0 \\le m < n$ be the residue of $2^n \\pmod n$. Note that since $\\textstyle m < n$ and $\\textstyle n \\ge 2$, necessarily $\\textstyle 2^m < 2^n -1$, and thus the remainder in question is $\\textstyle 2^m$. We want to show that $\\textstyle 2^m \\pmod {2^n-1}$ is an odd power of 2 for some $\\textstyle n$, and thus not a power of 4.\nLet $\\textstyle n=p^2$ for some odd prime $\\textstyle p$. Then $\\textstyle \\varphi(p^2) = p^2 - p$. Since 2 is co-prime to $\\textstyle p^2$, we have\n\\[{2^{\\varphi(p^2)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p^2}}\\]\nand thus\n\\[\\textstyle 2^{p^2} \\equiv 2^{(p^2 - p) + p} \\equiv 2^p \\pmod{p^2}.\\]\nTherefore, for a counter-example, it suffices that $\\textstyle 2^p \\pmod{p^2}$ be odd. Choosing $\\textstyle p=5$, we have $\\textstyle 2^5 = 32 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{25}$. Therefore, $\\textstyle 2^{25} \\equiv 7 \\pmod{25}$ and thus\n\\[\\textstyle 2^{2^{25}} \\equiv 2^7 \\pmod {2^{25} - 1}.\\]\nSince $\\textstyle 2^7$ is not a power of 4.",
    "Solution 2": "Lemma (useful for all situations): If $x$ and $y$ are positive integers such that $2^x - 1$ divides $2^y - 1$, then $x$ divides $y$.\nProof: $2^y \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^x - 1}$. Replacing the $1$ with a $2^x$ and dividing out the powers of two should create an easy induction proof which will be left to the reader as an Exercise.\nConsider $n = 25$. We will prove that this case is a counterexample via contradiction.\nBecause $4 = 2^2$, we will assume there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $2^{2^n} - 2^{2k}$ divides $2^n - 1$ and $2^{2k} < 2^n - 1$. Dividing the powers of $2$ from LHS gives $2^{2^n - 2k} - 1$ divides $2^n - 1$. Hence, $2^n - 2k$ divides $n$. Because $n = 25$ is odd, $2^{24} - k$ divides $25$. Euler's theorem gives $2^{24} \\equiv 2^4 \\equiv 16 \\pmod{25}$ and so $k \\ge 16$. However, $2^{2k} \\geq 2^{32} > 2^{25} - 1$, a contradiction. Thus, $n = 25$ is a valid counterexample."
