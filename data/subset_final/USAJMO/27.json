  "problem": "Let $b\\geq 2$ be an integer, and let $s_b(n)$ denote the sum of the digits of $n$ when it is written in base $b$.  Show that there are infinitely many positive integers that cannot be represented in the form $n+s_b(n)$, where $n$ is a positive integer.",

    "Solution 1": "Define $S(n) = n + s_b(n)$, and call a number  if it cannot equal $S(n)$ for a positive integer $n$.\nWe claim that in the interval $(b^p, b^{p+1}]$ there exists an unrepresentable number, for every positive integer $p$.\nIf $b^{p+1}$ is unrepresentable, we're done. Otherwise, time for our lemma:\nLemma: Define the function $f(p)$ to equal the number of integers x less than $b^p$ such that $S(x) \\ge b^p$. If $b^{p+1} = S(y)$ for some y, then $f(p+1) > f(p)$.\nProof: Let $F(p)$ be the set of integers x less than $b^p$ such that $S(x) \\ge b^p$. Then for every integer in $F(p)$, append the digit $(b-1)$ to the front of it to create a valid integer in $F(p+1)$. Also, notice that $(b-1) \\cdot b^p \\le y < b^{p+1}$. Removing the digit $(b-1)$ from the front of y creates a number that is not in $F(p)$. Hence, $F(p) \\rightarrow F(p+1)$, but there exists an element of $F(p+1)$ not corresponding with $F(p)$, so $f(p+1) > f(p)$.\nNote that our lemma combined with the Pigeonhole Principle essentially proves the claim. Therefore, because there are infinitely many disjoint intervals containing an unrepresentable number, there are infinitely many unrepresentable numbers.",
    "Solution 2": "Let $f(n) = n + s_b(n)$. It is easy to see that $f(b^2) = b^2 + 1$, and $f(b^2 - b + 1) = b^2 - b + 1 + b - 1 + 1 = b^2 + 1$, because the digits of $b^2 - b + 1$ are $b-1$ and $1$. Additionally, if we take any number, let's say $x$, and multiply it by $b^3$, and then add it to $b^2$ and $b^2 - b + 1$, we still obtain $f(b^3x + b^2) = f(b^3x + b^2 - b + 1)$, because we are simply adding $b^3x + x$ to each value. \nThus, we conclude that there are infinitely many numbers that are counted twice in $f(n)$, and that these numbers come $x^3$ apart. Finally, it is clear that for a large $N$, the number of numbers that are counted at least twice is at least $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{x^3}\\right\\rfloor$. Because $f(n) > n$ for all $n$, this means that there are at least $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{x^3}\\right\\rfloor$ numbers uncounted, and because this is unbounded, the proof is complete."
