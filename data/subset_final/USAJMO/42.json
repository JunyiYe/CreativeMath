    "Solution": "$\\textbf{Lemma: }$ For fixed $i\\neq j,$ where $i, j\\in\\{1, 2, ..., p\\},$ the statement $a_i + ik\\equiv a_j + jk\\text{ (mod } p\\text{)}$ holds for exactly one $k\\in {1, 2, ..., p}.$\n$\\textbf{Proof: }$ Notice that the left side minus the right side is congruent to $(a_i - a_j) + (i - j)k$ modulo $p.$ For this difference to equal $0,$ there is a unique solution for $k$ modulo $p$ given by $k\\equiv (a_j - a_i)(i - j)^{-1}\\text{ (mod } p\\text{)},$ where we have used the fact that every nonzero residue modulo $p$ has a unique multiplicative inverse. Therefore, there is exactly one $k\\in {1, 2, ..., p}$ that satisfies $a_i + ik\\equiv a_j + jk\\text{ (mod } p\\text{)}$ for any fixed $i\\neq j. \\textbf{ End Lemma}$\nSuppose that you have $p$ graphs $G_1, G_2, ..., G_p,$ and graph $G_k$ consists of the vertices $(i, k)$ for all $1\\le i\\le p.$ Within any graph $G_k,$ vertices $(i_1, k)$ and $(i_2, k)$ are connected by an edge if and only if $a_{i_1} + i_1k\\equiv a_{i_2} + i_2k\\text{ (mod } p\\text{)}.$ Notice that the number of disconnected components of any graph $G_k$ equals the number of distinct remainders when divided by $p$ given by the numbers $a_1 + k, a_2 + 2k, ..., a_p + pk.$\nThese $p$ graphs together have exactly one edge for every unordered pair of elements of $\\{1, 2, ..., p\\},$ so they have a total of exactly $\\frac{p(p-1)}{2}$ edges. Therefore, there exists at least one graph $G_k$ that has strictly fewer than $\\frac{p}{2}$ edges, meaning that it has more than $\\frac{p}{2}$ disconnected components. Therefore, the collection of numbers $\\{a_i + ik: 1\\le i\\le p\\}$ for this particular value of $k$ has at least $\\frac{p}{2}$ distinct remainders modulo $p.$ This completes the proof."
