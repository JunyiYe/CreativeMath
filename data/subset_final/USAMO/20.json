  "problem": "Let $p$ be a prime number and let $s$ be an integer with $0 < s < p$. Prove that there exist integers $m$ and $n$ with $0 < m < n < p$ and\nif and only if $s$ is not a divisor of $p-1$.\nNote: For $x$ a real number, let $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ denote the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, and let $\\{x\\} = x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor$ denote the fractional part of $x$.",

    "Solution 1": "We proceed by contradiction.  Assume that $s|(p-1)$.  Then for some positive integer $k$, $sk=p-1$.  The conditions given are equivalent to stating that $sm \\bmod p < sn \\bmod p< s\\bmod p$.\nNow consider the following array modulo p:\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccccc} \\mbox{Row 1}& s& 2s&\\hdots& ks\\\\ \\mbox{Row 2}& s-1& 2s-1& \\hdots&ks-1\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\ \\mbox{Row }s& 1& s+1& \\hdots& (k-1)s+1 \\end{array}\\]\nObviously, there are $s$ rows and $k$ columns. The first entry of each row is simply $((r-1)k+1)s\\mod p$.  Since we wish for $sm\\mod p$ and $sn\\mod p$ to both be in the first column, while also satisfying the given conditions, we can easily see that $sm$ must be in a row $m_r$ with $m_r>n_r$, where $n_r$ denotes the row $sn \\mod p$ is in.  However, since the values of each entry decreases while $((r-1)k+1)s$ keeps increasing, we can see that the condition can never be satisfied and thus, $s\\not|(p-1).$\nTo prove the other direction, let $sj+r=p-1$ for positive integers $j$ and $r$ with $j$ being the largest integer such that $sj<p-1$ and $r<s$. Since $s\\not|(p-1)$, $1<s<p-1$.\nNote that for $0<l<j$, $ls\\ge s\\mod p$.  Thus, the first integer multiplied by s modulo p that will be less than s is $j+1.$ $(j+1)s\\equiv s-r-1\\mod p$.  Since $\\lbrace s,2s,\\hdots,js,(j+1)s,\\hdots,xs,\\hdots,(p-1)s \\rbrace$ is a complete residue system mod p with the exception of the 0 term, we can find an $x>j+1$ such that $xs \\equiv s-1 \\mod p$.\nThus, choose $m=j+1$ and $n=x$ to complete the proof."
