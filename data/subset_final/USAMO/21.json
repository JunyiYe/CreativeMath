  "problem": "Let $ABCDEF$ be a convex hexagon satisfying $\\overline{AB} \\parallel \\overline{DE}$, $\\overline{BC} \\parallel \\overline{EF}$, $\\overline{CD} \\parallel \\overline{FA}$, and\\[AB \\cdot DE = BC \\cdot EF = CD \\cdot FA.\\]Let $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ be the midpoints of $\\overline{AD}$, $\\overline{BE}$, and $\\overline{CF}$. Prove that the circumcenter of $\\triangle ACE$, the circumcenter of $\\triangle BDF$, and the orthocenter of $\\triangle XYZ$ are collinear.",

    "Solution 1": "Let $M_1$, $M_2$, and $M_3$ be the midpoints of $CE$, $AE$, $AC$ and $N_1$, $N_2$, and $N_3$ be the midpoints of $DF$, $BF$, and $BD$. Also, let $H$ be the orthocenter of $XYZ$. Note that we can use parallel sides to see that $X$, $Z$, and $M_3$ are collinear. Thus we have \\[\\text{Pow}(M_3,(XYZ)) = M_3Z \\cdot M_3X = \\frac 14 AB \\cdot DE\\] by midlines. Applying this argument cyclically, and noting the condition $AB \\cdot DE = BC \\cdot EF = CD \\cdot FA$, $M_1$, $M_2$, $M_3$, $N_1$, $N_2$, $N_3$ all lie on a circle concentric with $(XYZ)$. \nNext, realize that basic orthocenter properties imply that the circumcenter $O_1$ of $(ACE)$ is the orthocenter of $\\triangle M_1M_2M_3$, and likewise the circumcenter $O_2$ of $(BDF)$ is the orthocenter of $\\triangle N_1N_2N_3$.\nThe rest is just complex numbers; toss on the complex plane so that the circumcenter of $\\triangle XYZ$ is the origin. Then we have \\[o_1 = m_1+m_2+m_3 = (c+e)/2+(a+e)/2+(a+c)/2=a+c+e\\] \\[o_2 = n_1+n_2+n_3 = (b+d)/2+(d+f)/2+(b+f)/2=b+d+f\\] \\[h = x+y+z = (a+d)/2+(b+e)/2+(c+f)/2=(a+b+c+d+e+f)/2.\\]\nNote that from the above we have $h=\\frac{o_1+o_2}{2}$, so $H$ is the midpoint of segment $O_1O_2$. In particular, $H$, $O_1$, and $O_2$ are collinear, as required.",
    "Solution 2": "We construct two equal triangles, prove that triangle $XYZ$ is the same as medial triangle of both this triangles. We use property of medial triangle and prove that circumcenters of constructed triangles coincide with given circumcenters.\nDenote $A' =  C + E \u2013 D, B' = D + F \u2013 E, C' =  A+ E \u2013 F,$\n$D' =  F+ B \u2013 A, E' =  A + C \u2013 B, F' =  B+ D \u2013 C.$\nThen $A' \u2013 D'  =  C + E \u2013 D \u2013  ( F+ B \u2013 A) = (A + C + E ) \u2013 (B+ D + F).$\nDenote  $D' \u2013 A' = 2\\vec V.$\nSimilarly we get $B' \u2013 E' = F' \u2013 C' =  D' \u2013 A'  \\implies$\n$\\triangle A'C'E' = \\triangle D'F'B'.$\nThe translation vector maps $\\triangle A'C'E'$ into $\\triangle D'F'B'$ is $2\\vec {V.}$\n$X = \\frac {A+D}{2} =  \\frac { (A+ E \u2013 F) + (D + F \u2013 E)}{2} =  \\frac {C' + B'}{2} = \\frac {E' + F'}{2},$\nso $X$ is midpoint of $AD, B'C',$ and $E'F'.$ Symilarly $Y$ is the midpoint of $BE, A'F',$ and $C'D', Z$ is the midpoint of $CF, A'B',$ and $D'E'.$\n$Z + V =  \\frac {A' + B'}{2}+ \\frac {D' \u2013 A'}{2} =  \\frac {B' + D'}{2} = Z'$ is the midpoint of $B'D'.$\nSimilarly $X' = X + V$  is the midpoint of $B'F',Y'= Y + V$  is the midpoint of $D'F'.$\nTherefore $\\triangle X'Y'Z'$ is the medial triangle of $\\triangle B'D'F'.$\n$\\triangle XYZ$ is $\\triangle X'Y'Z'$ translated on $\u2013 \\vec {V}.$\nIt is known (see diagram) that circumcenter of triangle coincide with orthocenter of the medial triangle. Therefore  orthocenter $H$ of $\\triangle XYZ$ is circumcenter of $\\triangle B'D'F'$ translated on $\u2013 \\vec {V}.$\nIt is the midpoint of segment $OO'$ connected circumcenters of $\\triangle B'D'F'$ and $\\triangle A'C'E'.$\nAccording to the definition of points $A', C', E',$ quadrangles $ABCE', CDEA',$ and $AFEC'$ are parallelograms. Hence\n\\[AC' = FE, AE' = BC, CE' = AB, CA' = DE, EA' = CD, EC' = AF \\implies\\]\n\\[AC' \\cdot AE' = CE' \\cdot CA' = EA' \\cdot EC' = AB \\cdot DE \\implies\\] Power of points A,C, and E with respect circumcircle $\\triangle A'C'E'$ is equal, hence distances between these points and circumcenter of $\\triangle A'C'E'$ are the same. Therefore circumcenter  $\\triangle ACE$ coincide with circumcenter  $\\triangle A'C'E'.$\nSimilarly circumcenter of $\\triangle BDF$ coincide with circumcenter of $\\triangle B'D'F'.$"
