  "problem": "Let $n$ be a nonnegative integer. Determine the number of ways that one can choose $(n+1)^2$ sets $S_{i,j}\\subseteq\\{1,2,\\ldots,2n\\}$, for integers $i,j$ with $0\\leq i,j\\leq n$, such that:\n$\\bullet$ for all $0\\leq i,j\\leq n$, the set $S_{i,j}$ has $i+j$ elements; and\n$\\bullet$ $S_{i,j}\\subseteq S_{k,l}$ whenever $0\\leq i\\leq k\\leq n$ and $0\\leq j\\leq l\\leq n$.",
  "solutions": {
    "Solution 1": "Note that there are $(2n)!$ ways to choose $S_{1, 0}, S_{2, 0}... S_{n, 0}, S_{n, 1}, S_{n, 2}... S_{n, n}$, because there are $2n$ ways to choose which number $S_{1, 0}$ is, $2n-1$ ways to choose which number to append to make $S_{2, 0}$, $2n-2$ ways to choose which number to append to make $S_{3, 0}$, etc. After that, note that $S_{n-1, 1}$ contains the $n-1$ in $S_{n-1, 0}$ and 1 other element chosen from the 2 elements in $S_{n, 1}$ not in $S_{n-1, 0}$ so there are 2 ways for $S_{n-1, 1}$. By the same logic there are 2 ways for $S_{n-1, 2}$ as well so $2^n$ total ways for all $S_{n-1, j}$, so doing the same thing $n-1$ more times yields a final answer of $(2n)!\\cdot 2^{\\left(n^2\\right)}$.",
    "Solution 3": "Let $C_{j}$ represent the set of sets of the form $S_{ij}$ for $1 \\le i \\le n$, $a_{ij}$ denote $S_{(i+1)j} \\backslash S_{ij}$, and $b_{ij} = S_{i(j+1)} \\backslash S_{ij}$. Begin by considering $C_0$ and $S_{00} = \\emptyset$. Then  given $S_{i0}$ we can create $S_{(i+1)0}$ by adding one element ($a_{i0}$). Using this, the number of ways to form the sequence of $S_{00}, S_{10}, \\dots, S_{n0}$ are $(2n)(2n-1) \\cdots (n+1)$ where we successively add one of the remaining elements of $[2n]$ to get consecutive terms in the sequence.\nNow consider when we are given $C_{j}$ and we need to find $C_{j+1}$. So far, there have been $n + j$ chosen distinct elements (via $S_{nj}$). After finding $C_{j+1}$ we will have $n + j + 1$ distinct elements and so in this process we only add one unique element to sets among $C_{j+1}$. There are $2n - (n+j) = n-j$ ways to chose such a new element called $x$.\nNow notice that $b_{0j}, a_{0(j+1)}, a_{1(j+1)}, \\dots, a_{(n-1)(j+1)}$ is a permutation of $x,  a_{0j}, \\dots, a_{(n-1)j}$ by noting $b_{nj} = x$ and,\n\\[S_{0j} + b_{0j} +  a_{0(j+1)} +  a_{1(j+1)} +  \\cdots +  a_{(n-1)(j+1)} = S_{n(j+1)} = S_{0j} +  a_{0j}+ a_{1j} +  \\cdots +  a_{(n-1)j} + b_{nj}\\]\nFurthermore,\n\\begin{align*} S_{0j} + b_{0j} + a_{0(j+1)} &= S_{1(j+1)} =  S_{0j} +  a_{0j} +  b_{1j} \\\\ S_{1j} + b_{1j} + a_{1(j+1)} &= S_{2(j+1)} = S_{1j} +  a_{1j} +  b_{2j} \\\\ &\\cdots \\\\ S_{(n-1)j} + b_{(n-1)j} + a_{(n-1)(j+1)} &= S_{n(j+1)} =  S_{(n-1)j} +  a_{(n-1)j} +  b_{nj} . \\end{align*}\nTherefore $b_{ij}, a_{i(j+1)}$ is a permutation of $a_{ij}, b_{(i+1)j}$ for $i < n$. Now let $k$ be the first $i$ such that $b_{ij} = x$. By definition, $b_{(k+1)j}, \\dots = x$. Then the number of ways to order $x,  a_{0j}, \\dots, a_{(n-1)j}$ is $2^{k-1}$ as there are 2 permutations for each pair before $\\{b_{ij}, a_{i(j+1)}\\} = \\{a_{ij}, b_{(i+1)j}\\}$ and each pair after is determined by $b_{ij}= b_{(i+1)j} = k, a_{i(j+1)} = a_{ij}$. For $k  = 0$, the permutation is completely determined so there is one way.\nOverall the number of ways to add the $j+1$'th row is, \\[(n-j)(1 + \\sum_{k = 1}^n 2^{k-1}) = 2^n(n-j).\\]\nIn total, there are $(2n)(2n-1)\\cdots (n+1)$ ways to find $C_0$ and for each $C_{j}$ there are $2^n(n-j+1)$ ways for $1 \\le j \\le n$. So the answer is, \\[\\frac{2n!}{n!}(2^nn)(2^{n}(n-1)) \\cdots (2^{n}1) = \\boxed{2^{n^2} \\cdot (2n)!}.\\]"
