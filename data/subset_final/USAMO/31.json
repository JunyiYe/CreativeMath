    "Solution": "Our proof is based on the following key Lemma.\n: If a circle $\\omega$, centered at $I$, is inscribed in a quadrilateral $ABCD$, then\n\\[BI^2 + \\frac{AI}{DI}\\cdot BI\\cdot CI = AB\\cdot BC.\\qquad\\qquad (1)\\]\n: Since circle $\\omega$ is inscribed in $ABCD$, we get $m\\angle DAI = m\\angle IAB = a$, $m\\angle ABI = m\\angle IBC = b$, $m\\angle BCI = m\\angle ICD = c$, $m\\angle CDI = m\\angle IDA = d$, and $a + b + c + d = 180^\\circ$. Construct a point $P$ outside of the quadrilateral such that $\\triangle ABP$ is similar to $\\triangle DCI$. We obtain\n\\begin{align*} m\\angle PAI + m\\angle PBI &= m\\angle PAB + m\\angle BAI + m\\angle PBA + m\\angle ABI \\\\ &= m\\angle IDC + a + m\\angle ICD + b \\\\ &= a + b + c + d = 180^\\circ, \\end{align*}\nimplying that the quadrilateral $PAIB$ is cyclic. By Ptolemy's Theorem, we have $AI\\cdot BP + BI\\cdot AP = AB\\cdot IP$, or\n\\[BP\\cdot\\frac{AI}{IP} + BI\\cdot\\frac{AP}{IP} = AB.\\qquad\\qquad (2)\\]\nBecause $PAIB$ is cyclic, it is not difficult to see that, as indicated in the figure, $m\\angle IPB = m\\angle IAB = a$, $m\\angle API = m\\angle ABI = b$, $m\\angle AIP = m\\angle ABP = c$, and $m\\angle PIB = m\\angle PAB = d$. Note that $\\triangle AIP$ and $\\triangle ICB$ are similar, implying that\n\\[\\frac{AI}{IP} = \\frac{IC}{CB}\\text{  and  }\\frac{AP}{IP} = \\frac{IB}{CB}.\\]\nSubstituting the above equalities into the identity $(2)$, we arrive at\n\\[BP\\cdot\\frac{CI}{BC} + \\frac{BI^2}{BC} = AB,\\]\nor\n\\[BP\\cdot CI + BI^2 = AB\\cdot BC.\\qquad\\qquad (3)\\]\nNote also that $\\triangle BIP$ and $\\triangle IDA$ are similar, implying that $\\frac{BP}{BI} = \\frac{IA}{ID}$, or\n\\[BP = \\frac{AI}{ID}\\cdot IB.\\]\nSubstituting the above identity back into $(3)$ gives the desired relation $(1)$, establishing the Lemma. $\\blacksquare$\nNow we prove our main result. By the Lemma and symmetry, we have\n\\[CI^2 + \\frac{DI}{AI}\\cdot BI\\cdot CI = CD\\cdot BC.\\qquad\\qquad (4)\\]\nAdding the two identities $(1)$ and $(4)$ gives\n\\[BI^2 + CI^2 + \\left(\\frac{AI}{DI} + \\frac{DI}{AI}\\right)BI\\cdot CI = BC(AB + CD).\\]\nBy the AM-GM Inequality, we have $\\frac{AI}{DI} + \\frac{DI}{AI}\\geq 2$. Thus,\n\\[BC(AB + CD)\\geq IB^2 + IC^2 + 2IB\\cdot IC = (BI + CI)^2,\\]\nwhere the equality holds if and only if $AI = DI$. Likewise, we have\n\\[AD(AB + CD)\\geq (AI + DI)^2,\\]\nwhere the equality holds if and only if $BI = CI$. Adding the last two identities gives\n\\[(AI + DI)^2 + (BI + CI)^2\\leq (AD + BC)(AB + CD) = (AB + CD)^2,\\]\nbecause $AD + BC = AB + CD$. (The latter equality is true because the circle $\\omega$ is inscribed in the quadrilateral $ABCD$.)\nBy the given condition in the problem, all the equalities in the above discussion must hold, that is, $AI = DI$ and $BI = CI$. Consequently, we have $a = d$, $b = c$, and so $\\angle DAB + \\angle ABC = 2a + 2b = 180^\\circ$, implying that $AD\\parallel BC$. It is not difficult to see that $\\triangle AIB$ and $\\triangle DIC$ are congruent, implying that $AB = CD$. Thus, $ABCD$ is an isosceles trapezoid."
