    "problem": "A calculator is broken so that the only keys that still work are the $\\, \\sin, \\; \\cos,$ $\\tan, \\; \\sin^{-1}, \\; \\cos^{-1}, \\,$ and $\\, \\tan^{-1} \\,$ buttons.  The display initially shows 0. Given any positive rational number $\\, q, \\,$ show that pressing some finite sequence of buttons will yield $\\, q$.   Assume that the calculator does real number calculations with infinite precision.  All functions are in terms of radians.\n\n\n",

        "Solution": "We will prove the following, stronger statementÂ :  If $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime nonnegative integers such that $n>0$, then the some finite sequence of buttons will yield $\\sqrt{m/n}$.\n\n\nTo prove this statement, we induct strongly on $m+n$.  For our base case, $m+n=1$, we have $n=1$ and $m=0$, and $\\sqrt{m/n} = 0$, which is initially shown on the screen.  For the inductive step, we consider separately the cases $m=0$, $0<m\\le n$, and $n<m$.\n\n\nIf $m=0$, then $n=1$, and we have the base case.\n\n\nIf $0< m \\le n$, then by inductive hypothesis, $\\sqrt{(n-m)/m}$ can be obtained in finitely many steps; then so can\n\\[\\cos \\tan^{-1} \\sqrt{(n-m)/m} = \\sqrt{m/n} .\\]\n\n\nIf $n<m$, then by the previous case, $\\sqrt{n/m}$ can be obtained in finitely many steps.  Since $\\cos \\tan^{-1} \\sqrt{n/m} = \\sin \\tan^{-1} \\sqrt{m/n}$, it follows that\n\\[\\tan \\sin^{-1} \\cos \\tan^{-1} \\sqrt{n/m} = \\sqrt{m/n}\\]\ncan be obtained in finitely many steps.  Thus the induction is complete.  $\\blacksquare$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Alternate Solution (using infinite descent):": "This solution is similar to the above solution. We can invert a number with\\[\\tan \\sin^{-1} \\cos \\tan^{-1} \\sqrt{n/m} = \\sqrt{m/n}\\] and we can get \\[\\tan \\sin^{-1} \\cos \\tan^{-1}\\cos\\tan^{-1}\\sqrt{x} = \\sqrt{x + 1}.\\]\nThen we do $\\sqrt{x}$ to $\\sqrt{x + 1}$ in reverse, trying to get 1. Subtracting one inside the radical for a fraction $\\sqrt{m/n}$ will eventually result in a fraction less than or equal to 1. Taking the reciprocal of this will result in a fraction greater than or equal to 1, and we can keep subtracting one inside the radical.\n\n\nWe do this repeatedly, and this should eventually result in 1 in a finite number of steps. This is because each time we do this, m+n is smaller. This is true even if $\\sqrt{m/n}$ can be simplified, as simplifying will only result in a smaller value. The smallest possible value of the fraction is 1/1, so this will be achieved after finite steps.\n\n\nFinally, we know that 1 is achievable as cos(0) = 1.\n\n\n~Unum\n\n\n\n\n\\textit{Alternate solutions are always welcome.
