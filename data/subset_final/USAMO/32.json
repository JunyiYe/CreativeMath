  "problem": "Let $\\mathcal{P}$ be a  with $n$ sides, $n\\ge3$. Any set of $n - 3$ diagonals of $\\mathcal{P}$ that do not intersect in the interior of the polygon determine a  of $\\mathcal{P}$ into $n - 2$ triangles. If $\\mathcal{P}$ is regular and there is a triangulation of $\\mathcal{P}$ consisting of only isosceles triangles, find all the possible values of $n$.",

    "Solution": "We label the vertices of $\\mathcal{P}$ as $P_0, P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_n$. Consider a diagonal $d = \\overline{P_a\\,P_{a+k}},\\,k \\le n/2$ in the triangulation. We show that $k$ must have the form $2^{m}$ for some nonnegative integer $m$.\nThis diagonal  $\\mathcal{P}$ into two regions $\\mathcal{Q},\\, \\mathcal{R}$, and is the side of an isosceles triangle in both regions.  suppose the area of $Q$ is less than the area of $R$ (so the  of $P$ does not lie in the interior of $Q$); it follows that the lengths of the edges and diagonals in $Q$ are all smaller than $d$. Thus $d$ must the be the base of the isosceles triangle in $Q$, from which it follows that the isosceles triangle is $\\triangle P_aP_{a+k/2}\\,P_{a+k}$, and so $2|k$. Repeating this process on the legs of isosceles triangle ($\\overline{P_aP_{a+k/2}},\\,\\overline{P_{a+k}P_{a+k/2}}$), it follows that $k = 2^m$ for some positive integer $m$ (if we allow , then we can also let $m=0$). \nNow take the isosceles triangle $P_xP_yP_z,\\,0 \\le x < y < z < n$ in the triangulation that contains the center of $\\mathcal{P}$ in its interior; if a diagonal passes through the center, select either of the isosceles triangles with that diagonal as an edge. Without loss of generality, suppose $P_xP_y = P_yP_z$. From our previous result, it follows that there are $2^a$ edges of $P$ on the minor arcs of $P_xP_y,\\, P_yP_z$ and $2^b$ edges of $P$ on the minor arc of $P_zP_x$, for positive integers $a,\\,b$. Therefore, we can write\n\\[n = 2 \\cdot 2^a + 2^b = 2^{a+1} + 2^{b},\\] so $n$ must be the sum of two powers of $2$. \n\nWe now claim that this condition is sufficient. Suppose without loss of generality that $a+1 \\ge b$; then we rewrite this as \n\\[n = 2^{b}(2^{a-b+1}+1).\\]\nBy , it follows that we can cover all the desired $n$.\nFor $n = 3,4$, this is trivial. For $k>1$, we construct the diagonals of equal length $\\overline{P_0P_{2^{k-1}}}$ and $\\overline{P_{2^{k-1}+1}P_0}$. This partitions $\\mathcal{P}$ into $3$ regions: an isosceles $\\triangle P_0P_{2^{k-1}}P_{2^{k-1}+1}$, and two other regions. For these two regions, we can recursively construct the isosceles triangles defined above in the second paragraph. It follows that we have constructed $2(2^{k-1}-1) + (1) = 2^k-1 = n-2$ isosceles triangles with non-intersecting diagonals, as desired.  \nWe construct the diagonals $\\overline{P_0P_2},\\ \\overline{P_2P_4},\\ \\ldots \\overline{P_{2n-2}P_0}$. This partitions $\\mathcal{P}$ into $n$ isosceles triangles of the form $\\triangle P_{2k}P_{2k+1}P_{2k+2}$, as well as a central regular polygon with $n$ sides. However, we know that there exists a triangulation for the $n$-sided polygon that yields $n-2$ isosceles triangles. Thus, we have created $(n) + (n-2) = 2n-2$ isosceles triangles with non-intersecting diagonals, as desired. \nIn summary, the answer is all $n$ that can be written in the form $2^{a+1} + 2^{b},\\, a,b \\ge 0$. Alternatively, this condition can be expressed as either $n=2^{k},\\, k \\ge 2$ (this is the case when $a+1 = b$) or $n$ is the sum of two distinct powers of $2$, where $1= 2^0$ is considered a power of $2$."
