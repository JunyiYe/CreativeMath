        "Solution 1": "Let the side length of the regular tetrahedron be $a$. Link and extend $AP$ to meet the plane containing triangle $BCD$ at $E$; link $AQ$ and extend it to meet the same plane at $F$. We know that $E$ and $F$ are inside triangle $BCD$ and that $\\angle PAQ = \\angle EAF$\n\n\nNow letâ€™s look at the plane containing triangle $BCD$ with points $E$ and $F$ inside the triangle. Link and extend $EF$ on both sides to meet the sides of the triangle $BCD$ at $I$ and $J$, $I$ on $BC$ and $J$ on $DC$. We have $\\angle EAF < \\angle IAJ$\n\n\nBut since $E$ and $F$ are interior of the tetrahedron, points $I$ and $J$ cannot be both at the vertices and $IJ < a$, $\\angle IAJ < \\angle BAD = 60$. Therefore, $\\angle PAQ < 60$.\n\n\nSolution with graphs posted at\n\n\nhttp://www.cut-the-knot.org/wiki-math/index.php?n=MathematicalOlympiads.USA1973Problem1\n\n\n\\textit{Alternate solutions are always welcome. If you have a different, elegant solution to this problem, please add it to this page.}\n\n\nhurdler: Remark on solution 1: This proof is not rigorous, in the very last step. The last step needs more justification.\n\n\n"
