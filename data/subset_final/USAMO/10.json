        "Solution": "Consider some sequence $C = c_0, \\ldots, c_n$ as the image of $A$ after $t$ has been applied some finite number of times.\n\n\n\\textbf{Lemma 1.}  If $t(c_k) = c_k = j$, then ${} c_j = \\cdots = c_{j+i} = \\cdots = c_k = j$ ($0 \\le i \\le k-j$).\n\n\n\\textit{Proof.} Since the $j$ terms $c_0, \\ldots, c_{j-1}$ are all less than $j$, no other terms that precede $c_{k}$ can be unequal to $c_k$.  The lemma follows.\n\n\n\\textbf{Lemma 2.} If $t(c_k) = c_k = j$, then $t^2(c_k) = t(c_k)$ (where $f^2(x) = f(f(x))$).\n\n\n\\textit{Proof.}  Since only $i$ terms precede the term $c_i$, we will have $t^m(c_i) \\le i$, for any integer $m$.  This means that we will always have $t^m (c_0), \\ldots, t^m (c_{j-1}) < j$.  This means that $c_j = t(c_j) = \\cdots = c_k = t(c_k)$, and the lemma follows by iteration.\n\n\nThus we may regard a term $c_k$ as \\textit{stable} if $t(c_k) = c_k$.  We will call a sequence \\textit{stable} if all of its terms are stable.\n\n\n\\textbf{Lemma 3.}  If $c_k =j$ is not stable, then $t(c_k) > c_k$.\n\n\n\\textit{Proof.} We have $c_0, \\ldots, c_{j-1} < j$, so we always have $t(c_k) \\ge c_k$.  Equality implies that $c_k$ is stable.\n\n\nWe will now prove the problem by induction.  For the base case, $n=1$, we have either 0,0 or 0,1, both of which are stable.  Now, suppose that $t^{n-2}(a_0), \\ldots, t^{n-2}(a_{n-1})$ are stable.  We must then have $t^{n-2}(a_n) \\in \\{ n-2, n-1, n\\}$.  If $t^{n-2}(a_n) = n$, then it is already stable.  If $t^{n-2}(a_n) = n-1$, then either it is already stable or $t^{n-1}(a_n) = n$, which is stable.  If $t^{n-2}(a_n) = t^{n-2}(a_{n-1})$, then $t^{n-2}(a_n)$ must already be stable.  The only possibilities remaining are $t^{n-2}(a_n) = n-2, t^{n-2}(a_{n-1}) = n-1$ and $t^{n-2}(a_n) = n-2, t^{n-2}(a_{n-1}) < n-2$.  In the first case, we must have $t^{n-1}(a_n)$ equal to $n-1$ or $n$, both of which will make it stable.  In the second case, we must have $t^{n-2}(a_{n-2}) = t^{n-2}(a_{n-1}) < n-2$, giving us $t^{n-1}(a_n) = n$, which will make it stable.  Thus the induction is complete.\n\n\n\n\n\\textit{Alternate solutions are always welcome. If you have a different, elegant solution to this problem, please add it to this page.}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
