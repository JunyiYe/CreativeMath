    "Solution": "We label each upper case point with the corresponding lower case letter as its assigned number. The key step is the following lemma.\n: If $ABCD$ is an isosceles trapezoid, then $a + c = b + d$.\n: Assume without loss of generality that $BC\\parallel AD$, and that rays $AB$ and $DC$ meet at $P$. Let $I$ be the incenter of triangle $PAC$, and let line $l$ bisect $\\angle APD$. Then $I$ is on $l$, so reflecting everything across line $l$ shows that $I$ is also the incenter of triangle $PDB$. Therefore,\n\\[\\frac{p + a + c}{3} = i = \\frac{p + b + d}{3}.\\]\nHence $a + c = b + d$, as desired.$\\blacksquare$\nFor any two distinct points $A_1$ and $A_2$ in the plane, we construct a regular pentagon $A_1A_2A_3A_4A_5$. Applying the lemma to isosceles trapezoids $A_1A_3A_4A_5$ and $A_2A_3A_4A_5$ yields\n\\[a_1 + a_4 = a_3 + a_5\\quad\\text{and}\\quad a_2 + a_4 = a_3 + a_5.\\]\nHence $a_1 = a_2$. Since $A_1$ and $A_2$ were arbitrary, all points in the plane are assigned the same number."
