    "problem": "If $P(x)$, $Q(x)$, $R(x)$, and $S(x)$ are all polynomials such that\n\\[P(x^5) + xQ(x^5) + x^2 R(x^5) = (x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x +1) S(x),\\]\nprove that $x-1$ is a factor of $P(x)$.\n\n\n",

        "Solution 1": "In general we will show that if $m$ is an integer less than $n$ and $P_0, \\dotsc, P_{m-1}$ and $S$ are polynomials satisfying\n\\[P_0(x^n) + x P_1(x^n) + \\dotsb + x^{m-1} P_{m-1}(x^n) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k S(x),\\]\nthen $P_k(1) = 0$, for all integers $0 \\le k \\le m-1$.  For the problem, we may set $n=5$, $m=3$, and then note that since $P(1)= 0$, $(x-1)$ is a factor of $P(x)$.\n\n\nIndeed, let $\\omega_1, \\dotsc, \\omega_{n-1}$ be the $n$th roots of unity other than 1.  Then for all integers $1 \\le i \\le n-1$,\n\\[\\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \\omega_i^k P_k(\\omega_i^n) = \\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \\omega_i^k P_k(1) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\omega_i^k S(\\omega_i) = \\frac{\\omega_i^{n-1} - 1}{\\omega_i - 1} S(\\omega_i) = 0 ,\\]\nfor all integers $1 \\le i \\le n$.  This means that the $(m-1)$th degree polynomial\n\\[\\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} x^k P_k(1)\\]\nhas $n-1 > m-1$ distinct roots.  Therefore all its coefficients must be zero, so $P_k = 0$ for all integers $0 \\le k \\le m-1$, as desired.  $\\blacksquare$\n\n",
        "Solution 2": "Let $\\zeta, \\xi, \\rho$ be three distinct primitive fifth roots of unity.\nSetting $x = \\zeta, \\xi$, we have\n\\begin{align*} P(1) + \\zeta Q(1) + \\zeta^2 R(1) &= \\frac{\\zeta^5-1}{\\zeta-1} S(\\zeta) = 0, \\\\ P(1) + \\xi Q(1) + \\xi^2 R(1) &= \\frac{\\xi^5-1}{\\xi-1} S(\\xi) = 0 . \\end{align*}\nThese equations imply that\n\\[\\zeta Q(1) + \\zeta^2 R(1) = \\xi Q(1) + \\xi^2 R(1),\\]\nor\n\\[Q(1) = - ( \\zeta + \\xi)R(1).\\]\nBut by symmetry,\n\\[Q(1) = - (\\zeta + \\rho)R(1) .\\]\nSince $\\xi \\neq \\rho$, it follows that $Q(1) = R(1) = 0$.  Then, as noted above,\n\\[P(1) = P(1) + \\zeta Q(1) + \\zeta^2 R(1) = 0,\\]\nso $(x-1)$ is a factor of $P(x)$, as desired.  $\\blacksquare$\n\n",
        "Solution 3": "Let $z, z^2, z^3$ be three of the 5th roots of unity not equal to one that satisfy $1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0$ as a result. Plugging them into the equation gives the linear system of equations in $(A(1), B(1), C(1))$:\n\n\n\\[A(1) + zB(1) + z^2C(1) = 0\\]\n\\[A(1) + z^2B(1) + z^4C(1) = 0\\]\n\\[A(1) + z^3B(1) + z^6C(1) = 0\\]\n\n\nDirect observation gives $(A(1), B(1), C(1)) = (0,0,0)$ as a solution, and there are no others because the system of equations is linear. Hence, $A(1) = 0$, and so $(x-1)$ is a factor of $A(x)$, as desired. $\\blacksquare$\n\n\n\\textit{Note: We can generalize this approach to prove the claim in Solution 1 in an equally fast, concise, and readily understandable fashion.}\n\n\n"
