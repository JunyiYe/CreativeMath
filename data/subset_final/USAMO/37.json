        "Solution": "In the solution below we use the expression $S$ \\textit{is stable under} $x\\mapsto f(x)$ to mean that if $x$ belongs to $S$ then $f(x)$ also belongs to $S$. If $c,d\\in S$, then by (B), $S$ is stable under $x\\mapsto c^2 - x$ and $x\\mapsto d^2 - x$, hence stable under $x\\mapsto c^2 - (d^2 - x) = x + (c^2 - d^2)$. Similarly $S$ is stable under $x\\mapsto x + (d^2 - c^2)$. Hence $S$ is stable under $x\\mapsto x + n$ and $x\\mapsto x - n$ whenever $n$ is an integer linear combination of numbers of the form $c^2 - d^2$ with $c,d\\in S$. In particular, this holds for $n = m$, where $m = \\gcd\\{c^2 - d^2Â : c,d\\in S\\}$.\n\n\nSince $S\\neq \\emptyset$ by (A), it suffices to prove that $m = 1$. For the sake of contradiction, assume that $m\\neq 1$. Let $p$ be a prime dividing $m$. Then $c^2 - d^2\\equiv 0\\pmod{p}$ for all $c,d\\in S$. In other words, for each $c,d\\in S$, either $d\\equiv c\\pmod{p}$ or $d\\equiv -c\\pmod{p}$. Given $c\\in S$, $c^2 - c\\in S$ by (B), so $c^2 - c\\equiv c\\pmod{p}$ or $c^2 - c\\equiv -c\\pmod{p}$. Hence\n\\[\\text{For each }c\\in S\\text{, either }c\\equiv 0\\pmod{p}\\text{ or }c\\equiv 2\\pmod{p}.\\qquad\\qquad (*)\\]\nBy (A), there exist some $a$ and $b$ in $S$ such that $\\gcd(a,b) = 1$, that is, at least one of $a$ or $b$ cannot be divisible by $p$. Denote such an element of $S$ by $\\alpha$: thus, $\\alpha\\not\\equiv 0\\pmod{p}$. Similarly, by (A), $\\gcd(a - 2, b - 2) = 1$, so $p$ cannot divide both $a - 2$ and $b - 2$. Thus, there is an element of $S$, call it $\\beta$, such that $\\beta\\not\\equiv 2\\pmod{p}$. By $(*)$, $\\alpha\\equiv 2\\pmod{p}$ and $\\beta\\equiv 0\\pmod{p}$. By (B), $\\beta^2 - \\alpha\\in S$. Taking $c = \\beta^2 - \\alpha$ in $(*)$ yields either $-2\\equiv 0\\pmod{p}$ or $-2\\equiv 2\\pmod{p}$, so $p = 2$. Now $(*)$ says that all elements of $S$ are even, contradicting (A). Hence our assumption is false and $S$ is the set of all integers.\n\n\n"
