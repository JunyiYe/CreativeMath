        "Solution": "Let $n=3k+1$.  Multiply throughout by $\\pi/3n$. We get \n\n\n$\\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\pi \\times k}{n} + \\frac{\\pi}{3n}$\n\n\nRe-arranging, we get\n\n\n$\\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\pi \\times k}{n} = \\frac{\\pi}{3n}$\n\n\nA way to interpret it is that if we know the value $k$, then the remainder angle of subtracting $k$ times the given angle from $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ gives us $\\frac{\\pi}{3n}$, the desired trisected angle.\n\n\nThis can be extended to the case when $n=3k+2$ where now, the equation becomes\n$\\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\pi \\times k}{n} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3n}$\n\n\nHence in this case, we will have to subtract $k$ times the original angle from $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ to get twice the the trisected angle. We can bisect it after that to get the trisected angle.\n\n\n"
