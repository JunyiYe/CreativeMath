    "problem": "Let $\\{X_n\\}$ and $\\{Y_n\\}$ denote two sequences of integers defined as follows:\n\n\n\\begin{center}\n $X_0=1$, $X_1=1$, $X_{n+1}=X_n+2X_{n-1}$ $(n=1,2,3,\\dots),$\\end{center}\n\\begin{center}\n$Y_0=1$, $Y_1=7$, $Y_{n+1}=2Y_n+3Y_{n-1}$ $(n=1,2,3,\\dots)$.\\end{center}\nThus, the first few terms of the sequences are:\n\n\n\\begin{center}\n $X:1, 1, 3, 5, 11, 21, \\dots$,\\end{center}\n\\begin{center}\n $Y:1, 7, 17, 55, 161, 487, \\dots$.\\end{center}\nProve that, except for the \"1\", there is no term which occurs in both sequences.\n\n\n",

        "Solution": "We can look at each sequence $\\bmod{8}$:\n\n\n\\begin{center}\n$X$: $1$, $1$, $3$, $5$, $3$, $5$, $\\dots$,\\end{center}\n\\begin{center}\n$Y$: $1$, $7$, $1$, $7$, $1$, $7$, $\\dots$.\\end{center}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Proof that $X$ repeats $\\bmod{8}$:\n\\end{itemize}\nThe third and fourth terms are $3$ and $5$ $\\bmod{8}$. Plugging into the formula, we see that the next term is $11\\equiv 3\\bmod{8}$, and plugging $5$ and $3$, we get that the next term is $13\\equiv 5\\bmod{8}$. Thus the sequence $X$ repeats, and the pattern is $3,5,3,5,\\dots$.\n\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Proof that $Y$ repeats $\\bmod{8}$:\n\\end{itemize}\nThe first and second terms are $1$ and $7$ $\\bmod{8}$. Plugging into the formula, we see that the next term is $17\\equiv 1\\bmod{8}$, and plugging $7$ and $1$, we get that the next term is $23\\equiv 7\\bmod{8}$. Thus the sequence $Y$ repeats, and the pattern is $1,7,1,7,\\dots$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining both results, we see that $X_i$ and $Y_j$ are not congruent $\\bmod{8}$ when $i\\geq 3$ and $j\\geq 2$. Thus after the \"1\", the terms of each sequence are not equal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\textit{Alternate solutions are always welcome.
