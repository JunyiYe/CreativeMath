  "problem": "Suppose that necklace $\\, A \\,$ has 14 beads and necklace $\\, B \\,$ has \n19. Prove that for any odd integer $n \\geq 1$, there is a way to number \neach of the 33 beads with an integer from the sequence\n\\[\\{ n, n+1, n+2, \\dots, n+32 \\}\\]\nso that each integer is used once, and adjacent beads correspond to \nrelatively prime integers. (Here a \"necklace\" is viewed as a circle in \nwhich each bead is adjacent to two other beads.)",

    "Solution": "For every positive odd integer $n$, there exists a nonnegative integer $k \\le 17$ such that $n+k$ is relatively prime to $n+k+15$, $n+k+1$ is relatively prime to $n+k+14$.\n  Consider the positive integers $n, n+1, n+2$.  Note that at most one of these is divisible by 3, and at most one is divisible by 5.  Therefore one of these, say $n+a$, is divisible by neither, and is therefore relatively prime to 15.  Furthermore, $n+a+1$ and $n+(a+15)+1$ have different residues mod 13, so one of them, say $n+b+1$, is relatively prime to 13.  Since $n+b \\equiv n+a \\pmod{15}$, $n+b$ is relatively prime to 15.  But\n\\[\\gcd(n+b,n+b+15) = \\gcd\\bigl[ n+b,(n+b+15) - (n+b) \\bigr] = \\gcd(n+b,15) = 1,\\]\nso $n+b$ is relatively prime to $n+b+15$.  Also,\n\\[\\gcd(n+b+1, n+b+14) = \\gcd \\bigl[ n+b+1, (n+b+14)-(n+b+1) \\bigr] = \\gcd( n+b+1, 13) ,\\]\nso $n+b+1$ is relatively prime to $n+b+14$.  Finally, $b \\le a+15 \\le 17$.  It follows that setting $k=b$ satisfies the lemma.  $\\blacksquare$\nLet $k$ be an integer as described in the lemma.  We place the integers $n, \\dotsc, n+k, n+k+15, \\dotsc, n+32$ on the necklace with 19 beads, and the integers $n+k+1, \\dotsc, n+k+14$ on the necklace with 14 beads, in those orders.  Since $n$ is odd, $n$ is relatively prime to $n+32 = n+2^5$.  By definition, $n+k$ and $n+k+15$ are relatively prime, as are $n+k+1$ and $n+k+14$; finally, $a$ and $a+1$ are relatively prime for all integers $a$.  It follows that each bead in this arrangement is relatively prime to its neighbors.  $\\blacksquare$"
