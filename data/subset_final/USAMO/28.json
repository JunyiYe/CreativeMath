        "Partial Solution": "For $n$ equal to any odd prime $p$, the sequence $\\left\\{a_i = \\left(\\frac{1-n}{2}\\right)^{m_p\\left(i\\right)}\\right\\}$, where $p^{m_p\\left(i\\right)}$ is the greatest power of $p$ that divides $i$, gives a valid sequence. Therefore, the set of possible values for $n$ is at least the set of odd primes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Solution that involves a non-elementary result": "(Since Bertrand's is well known and provable using elementary techniques, I see nothing wrong with this-tigershark22)\n\n\nFor $n=2$, $|a_1| = 2 |a_2| = \\cdots = 2^m |a_{2^m}|$ implies that for any positive integer $m$, $|a_1| \\ge 2^m$, which is impossible.\n\n\nWe proceed to prove that the infinite sequence exists for all $n\\ge 3$.\n\n\nFirst, one notices that if we have $a_{xy} = a_x a_y$ for any integers $x$ and $y$, then it is suffice to define all $a_x$ for $x$ prime, and one only needs to verify the equation (*)\n\n\n\\[a_1+2a_2+\\cdots+na_n=0\\]\n\n\nfor the other equations will be automatically true.\n\n\nTo proceed with the construction, I need the following fact: for any positive integer $m>2$, there exists a prime $p$ such that $\\frac{m}{2} <p \\le m$.\n\n\nTo prove this, I am going to use \\textbf{Bertrand's Postulate} ([1]) without proof. The Theorem states that, for any integer $n>1$, there exists a prime $p$ such that $n<p\\le 2n-1$. In other words, for any positive integer $m>2$, if $m=2n$ with $n>1$, then there exists a prime $p$ such that $\\frac{m}{2} < p <  m$, and if $m=2n-1$ with $n>1$, then there exists a prime $p$ such that $\\frac{m+1}{2} <p\\le m$, both of which guarantees that for any integer $m>2$, there exists a prime $p$ such that $\\frac{m}{2} <p \\le m$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo back to the problem. Suppose $n\\ge 3$. Let the largest two primes not larger than $n$ are $P$ and $Q$, and that $n\\ge P > Q$. By the fact stated above, one can conclude that $2P > n$, and that $4Q = 2(2Q) \\ge 2P > n$. Let's construct $a_n$:\n\n\nLet $a_1=1$. There will be three cases: (i) $Q>\\frac{n}{2}$,  (ii) $\\frac{n}{2} \\ge Q > \\frac{n}{3}$, and (iii) $\\frac{n}{3} \\ge Q > \\frac{n}{4}$.\n\n\nCase (i): $2Q>n$. Let $a_x = 1$ for all prime numbers $x<Q$, and $a_{xy}=a_xa_y$, then (*) becomes:\n\n\n\\[Pa_P + Qa_Q = C_1\\]\n\n\nCase (ii): $2Q\\le n$ but $3Q > n$. In this case, let $a_2=-1$, and $a_x = 1$ for all prime numbers $2<x<Q$, and $a_{xy}=a_xa_y$, then (*) becomes:\n\n\n\\[Pa_P + Qa_Q - Qa_{2Q} = C_2\\]\n\n\nor\n\n\n\\[Pa_P - Qa_Q = C_2\\]\n\n\nCase (iii): $3Q\\le n$. In this case, let $a_2=3$, $a_3=-2$, and $a_x = 1$ for all prime numbers $3<x<Q$, and $a_{xy}=a_xa_y$, then (*) becomes:\n\n\n\\[Pa_P + Qa_Q + 3Qa_{2Q} - 2Qa_{3Q} = C_3\\]\n\n\nor\n\\[Pa_P + Qa_Q = C_3\\]\n\n\nIn each case, by Bezout's Theorem, there exists non zero integers $a_P$ and $a_Q$ which satisfy the equation. For all other primes $p > P$, just let $a_p=1$ (or any other non-zero integer).\n\n\nThis construction is correct because, for any $k> 1$, \n\n\n\\[a_k + 2 a_{2k} + \\cdots n a_{nk} =  a_k (1 + 2 a_2 + \\cdots n a_n ) = 0\\]\n\n\nSince Bertrand's Theorem is not elementary, we still need to wait for a better proof.\n\n\n--Lightest 21:24, 2 May 2012 (EDT)\n\n\n"
