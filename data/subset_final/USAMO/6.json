        "Solution": "\\textbf{Part 1}) Prove that $f_n$ is constant for sufficiently large $n$.\n\n\nNote that if there is some $f_n=f_{n-1}$ for any $n$, then $\\frac{f_{n}+f_{n-1}}{2}=f_n$, which is odd. Thus, $f_{n+1}=f_n=f_{n-1}$ and by induction, all $f_p$ is constant for $p\\ge n$.\n\n\nAlso note that $f_n>0$ since average of $2$ positive number is always positive.\n\n\n\n\nThus, assume for contradiction, $\\nexists n$, $f_n=f_{n-1}$.\n\n\nThen, $f_{n+1}\\le\\frac{f_{n}+f_{n-1}}{2}< \\max (f_{n},f_{n-1})$, $f_{n+2}\\le\\frac{f_{n+1}+f_{n}}{2}< \\max (f_{n},f_{n+1})\\le\\max (f_{n},f_{n-1})$\n\n\nThus, $\\max (f_{n},f_{n-1})> \\max (f_{n+1},f_{n+2})$ and that means that $\\max (f_{2n},f_{2n+1})$ is a strictly decreasing function and it must reach $0$ as $n\\rightarrow\\infty$, which contradict with the fact that $f_n>0$.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Part 1} proven.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\hrule\n\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Part 2}) Show that the constant is $\\gcd(a,b)$.\n\n\nFor any $f_n$ where $\\gcd(a,b)=d\\ne1$. $f_n=dg_n$ for $g_n$ with the same property except with $g_1=\\frac{a}{d}$ and $g_2=\\frac{b}{d}$.\n\n\nTherefore, if I prove that the constant for any $f_n$ with relatively prime $a$, $b$ is $1$, then I have shown that \\textbf{part 2} is true.\n\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Lemma}) If $\\gcd(f_n,f_{n-1})=1$, then $\\gcd(f_n,f_{n+1})=1$.\n\n\nAssume for contradiction that $\\gcd(f_n,f_{n+1})=d\\ne1$, since both $f_n$ and $f_{n+1}$ are odd, $d$ is not divisible by $2$.\n\n\n$f_{n+1}=\\frac{f_n+f_{n-1}}{2^n}$ for some $n\\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$ such that $f_{n+1}$ is odd.\n\n\n$(2^n)f_{n+1}-f_n=f_{n-1}$\n\n\n$d(p+q)=f_{n-1}$, where $p$ and $q$ is another integer.\n\n\nThus, $f_{n-1}$ is divisible by $d$ which contradicts with the assumption that $\\gcd(f_n,f_{n-1})=1$.\n\n\n\\textbf{Lemma proven}\n\n\n\n By induction, $\\gcd(f_n,f_{n-1})=1$ since $\\gcd(a,b)=\\gcd(f_1,f_2)=1$.\n\n\nSince there must exist some $n$ where $f_n=f_{n+1}$ (part 1), $\\gcd(f_n,f_{n+1})=f_n=1$.\n\n\n$\\mathbb{Q.E.D}$\n\n"
