  "problem": "The mean, median, unique mode, and range of a collection of eight integers are all equal to 8. The largest integer that can be an element of this collection is \n$\\text{(A) }11 \\qquad \\text{(B) }12 \\qquad \\text{(C) }13 \\qquad \\text{(D) }14 \\qquad \\text{(E) }15$",

    "Solution 1": "As the unique mode is $8$, there are at least two $8$s.\nAs the range is $8$ and one of the numbers is $8$, the largest one can be at most $16$.\nIf the largest one is $16$, then the smallest one is $8$, and thus the mean is strictly larger than $8$, which is a contradiction.\nIf we have 2 8's we can add find the numbers 4, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 12.\nThis is a possible solution but has not reached the maximum.\nIf we have 4 8's we can find the numbers 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 14.\nWe can also see that they satisfy the need for the mode, median, and range to be 8. This means that the answer will be\n$\\boxed{\\text{(D)}\\ 14 }$. ",
    "Solution 2": "We could express this collection as integers $a\\textsubscript{1}$ through $a\\textsubscript{8}$, with $a\\textsubscript{1}$ being the smallest and $a\\textsubscript{8}$ being the largest.\nSince the mean is $8$, we know that $a\\textsubscript{4}$ and $a\\textsubscript{5}$ must also be $8$. If they were not, the other numbers, which are lesser and greater than $a\\textsubscript{4}$ and $a\\textsubscript{5}$ respectively, would not be able to satisfy the condition that $8$ is the mode.\nThere are $8$ terms and the mean is $8$. This tells us that the sum of all the numbers is $64$.\nWe want to maximize the value of $a\\textsubscript{8}$, so we set  $a\\textsubscript{6}$ and $a\\textsubscript{7}$ to $8$ as well.\nKnowing that we want to minimize numbers and that the range is $8$ , we set $a\\textsubscript{1}$, $a\\textsubscript{2}$, and $a\\textsubscript{3}$ equal to $a\\textsubscript{8} - 8$.\n{$a\\textsubscript{1}$, $a\\textsubscript{2}$, $a\\textsubscript{3}$, $a\\textsubscript{4}$, $a\\textsubscript{5}$, $a\\textsubscript{6}$, $a\\textsubscript{7}$, $a\\textsubscript{8}$} $=$ {$a\\textsubscript{8} - 8$, $a\\textsubscript{8} - 8$, $a\\textsubscript{8} - 8$, $8$, $8$, $8$, $8$, $a\\textsubscript{8}$}\nLetting the sum of all the numbers be $64$, we find that $32 + 4a_8 - 24 = 64$, which simplifies to $4a_8 = 56$. Solving, we get $\\boxed{\\text{(D)}\\ 14 }$. "
