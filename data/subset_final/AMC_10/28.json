  "problem": "A triathlete competes in a triathlon in which the swimming, biking, and running segments are all of the same length. The triathlete swims at a rate of 3 kilometers per hour, bikes at a rate of 20 kilometers per hour, and runs at a rate of 10 kilometers per hour. Which of the following is closest to the triathlete's average speed, in kilometers per hour, for the entire race?\n$\\mathrm{(A)}\\ 3\\qquad\\mathrm{(B)}\\ 4\\qquad\\mathrm{(C)}\\ 5\\qquad\\mathrm{(D)}\\ 6\\qquad\\mathrm{(E)}\\ 7$",
  "solutions": {
    "Solution": "Let $d$ be the length of one segment of the race.\nAverage speed is total distance divided by total time. The total distance is $3d$, and the total time is $\\frac{d}{3}+\\frac{d}{20}+\\frac{d}{10}=\\frac{29d}{60}$.\nThus, the average speed is $3d\\div\\left(\\frac{29d}{60}\\right)=\\frac{180}{29}$. This is closest to $6$, so the answer is $\\mathrm{(D)}$.",
    "Solution 2": "Since the three segments are all the same length, the triathlete's average speed is the  harmonic mean of the three given rates. Therefore, the average speed is \\[\\frac{3}{\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{20}+\\frac{1}{10}}=\\frac{3}{\\frac{29}{60}}=\\frac{180}{29}\\approx6\\Rightarrow\\boxed{\\mathrm{(D)}\\ 6}\\]."
