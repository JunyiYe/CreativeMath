  "problem": "On a certain math exam, $10\\%$ of the students got $70$ points, $25\\%$ got $80$ points, $20\\%$ got $85$ points, $15\\%$ got $90$ points, and the rest got $95$ points.  What is the difference between the mean and the median score on this exam?\n$\\textbf{(A) }\\ 0 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) }\\ 1 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) }\\ 2 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) }\\ 4 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) }\\ 5$",

    "Solution": "To begin, we see that the remaining $30\\%$ of the students got $95$ points. Assume that there are $20$ students; we see that $2$ students got $70$ points, $5$ students got $80$ points, $4$ students got $85$ points, $3$ students got $90$ points, and $6$ students got $95$ points. The median is $85$, since the $10^{\\text{th}}$ and $11^{\\text{th}}$ terms are both $85$. The mean is $\\dfrac{70\\,(2)+80\\,(5)+85\\,(4)+90\\,(3)+95\\,(6)}{20}=\\dfrac{1720}{20}=86$. The difference between the mean and median, therefore, is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 1}$.",
    "Solution 2": "The remaining $30\\%$ of the students got $95$ points.\nThe mean is equal to $10\\%\\cdot70 + 25\\%\\cdot80 + 20\\%\\cdot85 + 15\\%\\cdot90 + 30\\%\\cdot95 = 86$.\nThe score greater than or equal to $50\\%$ of other scores is the median. Since $35\\%$ scored $80$ or lower and the next $20\\%$ scored $85$, the median is $85$. The difference between the mean and the median is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 1}$."
