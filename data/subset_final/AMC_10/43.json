  "problem": "Let $B$ be a right rectangular prism (box) with edges lengths $1,$ $3,$ and $4$, together with its interior. For real $r\\geq0$, let $S(r)$ be the set of points in $3$-dimensional space that lie within a distance $r$ of some point in $B$. The volume of $S(r)$ can be expressed as $ar^{3} + br^{2} + cr +d$, where $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d$ are positive real numbers. What is $\\frac{bc}{ad}?$\n$\\textbf{(A) } 6 \\qquad\\textbf{(B) } 19 \\qquad\\textbf{(C) } 24 \\qquad\\textbf{(D) } 26 \\qquad\\textbf{(E) } 38$",

    "Solution": "Split $S(r)$ into 4 regions: \n1. The rectangular prism itself\n2. The extensions of the faces of $B$\n3. The quarter cylinders at each edge of $B$\n4. The one-eighth spheres at each corner of $B$\n\nRegion 1: The volume of $B$ is $1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 = 12$, so $d=12$.\nRegion 2: This volume is equal to the surface area of $B$ times $r$ (these \"extensions\" are just more boxes). The volume is then $\\text{SA} \\cdot r=2(1 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\cdot 4 + 3 \\cdot 4)r=38r$ to get $c=38$.\nRegion 3: We see that there are 12 quarter-cylinders, 4 of each type. We have 4 quarter-cylinders of height 1, 4 quarter-cylinders of height 3, 4 quarter-cylinders of height 4. Since 4 quarter-cylinders make a full cylinder, the total volume is $4 \\cdot \\dfrac{1\\pi r^2}{4} + 4 \\cdot \\dfrac{3\\pi r^2}{4} + 4 \\cdot \\dfrac{4 \\pi r^2}{4}=8 \\pi r^2$. Therefore, $b=8\\pi$. \nRegion 4: There is an eighth-sphere of radius $r$ at each corner of $B$. Since there are 8 corners, these eighth-spheres add up to 1 full sphere of radius $r$. The volume of this sphere is then $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\cdot r^3$, so $a=\\frac{4\\pi}{3}$.\nUsing these values, $\\dfrac{bc}{ad}=\\frac{(8\\pi)(38)}{(4\\pi/3)(12)} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }19}$."
