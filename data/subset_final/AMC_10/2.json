  "problem": "Right triangle $ABC$ has leg lengths $AB=20$ and $BC=21$. Including $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{BC}$, how many line segments with integer length can be drawn from vertex $B$ to a point on hypotenuse $\\overline{AC}$?\n$\\textbf{(A) }5 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) }8 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) }12 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) }13 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) }15 \\qquad$",

    "Solution 1": "[asy] unitsize(4); pair A, B, C, E, P; A=(-20, 0); B=origin; C=(0,21); E=(-21, 20); P=extension(B,E, A, C); draw(A--B--C--cycle); draw(B--P); dot(\"$A$\", A, SW); dot(\"$B$\", B, SE); dot(\"$C$\", C, NE); dot(\"$P$\", P, NW); [/asy]\nAs the problem has no diagram, we draw a diagram. The hypotenuse has length $29$. Let $P$ be the foot of the altitude from $B$ to $AC$. Note that $BP$ is the shortest possible length of any segment. Writing the area of the triangle in two ways, we can solve for $BP=\\dfrac{20\\cdot  21}{29}$, which is between $14$ and $15$. \nLet the line segment be $BX$, with $X$ on $AC$. As you move $X$ along the hypotenuse from $A$ to $P$, the length of $BX$ strictly decreases, hitting all the integer values from $20, 19, \\dots 15$ (IVT). Similarly, moving $X$ from $P$ to $C$ hits all the integer values from $15, 16, \\dots, 21$. This is a total of $\\boxed{(D) 13}$ distinct line segments.",
    "Solution 2 - Circles": "Note that if a circle with an integer radius $r$ centered at vertex $B$ intersects hypotenuse $\\overline{AB}$, the lines drawn from $B$ to the points of intersection are integer lengths. As in the previous solution, the shortest distance $14<\\overline{BP}<15$. As a result, a circle of $14$ will  reach the hypotenuse and thus does not intersect it. We also know that a circle of radius $21$ intersects the hypotenuse once and a circle of radius $\\{15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 \\}$ intersects the hypotenuse twice. Quick graphical thinking or Euclidean construction will prove this.\n[asy] unitsize(4); pair A, B, C, E, P; A=(-20, 0); B=origin; C=(0,21); E=(-21, 20); P=extension(B,E, A, C); draw(A--B--C--cycle); draw(B--P); dot(\"$A$\", A, SW); dot(\"$B$\", B, SE); dot(\"$C$\", C, NE); dot(\"$P$\", P, S); draw(arc((0,0),21, 90, 180)); draw(arc((0,0),20, 90, 180)); draw(arc((0,0),19, 90, 180)); draw(arc((0,0),18, 90, 180)); draw(arc((0,0),17, 90, 180)); draw(arc((0,0),16, 90, 180)); draw(arc((0,0),15, 90, 180)); [/asy]\nIt follows that we can draw circles of radii $15, 16, 17, 18, 19,$ and $20,$ that each contribute  integer lengths (since these circles intersect the hypotenuse twice) from $B$ to $\\overline{AC}$ and one circle of radius $21$ that contributes only one such segment. Our answer is then \\[6 \\cdot 2 + 1 = 13 \\implies \\boxed{D}\\] "
