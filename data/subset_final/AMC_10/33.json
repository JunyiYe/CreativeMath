  "problem": "The line $12x+5y=60$ forms a triangle with the coordinate axes. What is the sum of the lengths of the altitudes of this triangle?\n$\\textbf{(A) } 20 \\qquad\\textbf{(B) } \\dfrac{360}{17} \\qquad\\textbf{(C) } \\dfrac{107}{5} \\qquad\\textbf{(D) } \\dfrac{43}{2} \\qquad\\textbf{(E) } \\dfrac{281}{13}$",

    "Solution 1": "We find the $x$-intercepts and the $y$-intercepts to find the intersections of the axes and the line. If $x=0$, then $y=12$. If $y$ is $0$, then $x=5$. Our three vertices are $(0,0)$, $(5,0)$, and $(0,12)$. Two of our altitudes are $5$ and $12$, and since it is a $5$-$12$-$13$ right triangle, the hypotenuse is $13$. Since the area of the triangle is $30$, so our final altitude is $\\frac{30(2)}{13}=\\frac{60}{13}$. The sum of our altitudes is $\\frac{60+156+65}{13}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} \\dfrac{281}{13}}$. Note that there is no need to calculate the final answer after we know that the third altitude has length $\\frac{60}{13}$ since $E$ is the only choice with a denominator of $13$ and $13$ is relatively prime to $5$ and $12$.",
    "Solution 2 (very similar to Solution 1)": "Noticing that the line has coefficients $12$ and $5$, we can suspect that we have a $5$-$12$-$13$ triangle on our hands. Because we want the sum of the altitudes, the third altitude that is not an axis must have a denominator of $13$. Since the other altitudes are integers, we choose the option with $13$ as the denominator, namely $E$."
