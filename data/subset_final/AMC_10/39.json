    "problem": "Bertha has 6 daughters and no sons.  Some of her daughters have 6 daughters, and the rest have none.  Bertha has a total of 30 daughters and granddaughters, and no great-granddaughters.  How many of Bertha's daughters and grand-daughters have no daughters?\n\n\n$\\mathrm{(A) \\ } 22 \\qquad \\mathrm{(B) \\ } 23 \\qquad \\mathrm{(C) \\ } 24 \\qquad \\mathrm{(D) \\ } 25 \\qquad \\mathrm{(E) \\ } 26$\n\n\n",
    "solutions": {
        "Solution 1": "Since Bertha has $6$ daughters, she has $30-6=24$ granddaughters, of which none have daughters.  Of Bertha's daughters, $\\frac{24}6=4$ have daughters, so $6-4=2$ do not have daughters. Therefore, of Bertha's daughters and granddaughters, $24+2=26$ do not have daughters.  $\\boxed{\\mathrm{(E)}\\ 26}$\n\n",
        "Solution 2 (From Alcumus)": "Bertha has $30 - 6 = 24$ granddaughters, none of whom have any daughters. The granddaughters are the children of $24/6 = 4$ of Bertha's daughters, so the number of women having no daughters is $30 - 4 = \\boxed{26}$.\n\n",
        "Solution 3": "Draw a tree diagram and see that the answer can be found in the sum of $6+6$ granddaughters, $5+5$ daughters, and $4$ more daughters.  Adding them together gives the answer of $\\boxed{\\mathrm{(E)}\\ 26}$.\n\n\n"
