    "problem": "Members of the Rockham Soccer League buy socks and T-shirts. Socks cost $4 per pair and each T-shirt costs $5 more than a pair of socks. Each member needs one pair of socks and a shirt for home games and another pair of socks and a shirt for away games. If the total cost is $2366, how many members are in the League? \n\n\n$\\mathrm{(A) \\ } 77\\qquad \\mathrm{(B) \\ } 91\\qquad \\mathrm{(C) \\ } 143\\qquad \\mathrm{(D) \\ } 182\\qquad \\mathrm{(E) \\ } 286$\n\n\n",
    "solutions": {
        "Solution": "Since T-shirts cost $5$ dollars more than a pair of socks, T-shirts cost $5+4=9$ dollars. \n\n\nSince each member needs $2$ pairs of socks and $2$ T-shirts, the total cost for $1$ member is $2(4+9)=26$ dollars. \n\n\nSince $2366$ dollars was the cost for the club, and $26$ was the cost per member, the number of members in the League is $2366\\div 26=\\boxed{\\mathrm{(B)}\\ 91}$. \n\n\n"
