    "Solution 1": "Consider a tetrahedron with vertices at $A,B,C,D$ on the $xyz$-plane. The length of $EF$ is just one-half of $AD$ because it is the midsegment of $\\triangle ABD.$ The same concept applies to the other side lengths. $AD=3$ and $BC=\\sqrt{1^2+2^2}=\\sqrt{5}$. Then $EF=HG=\\frac32$ and $EH=FG=\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}$. The line segments lie on perpendicular planes so quadrilateral $EFGH$ is a rectangle. The area is\n\\[EF \\cdot FG = \\frac 32 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\frac{3\\sqrt 5} 4\\implies \\boxed{\\textbf C}.\\]\n[asy] import three; draw((0,0,0)--(1,0,0)--(0,0,3)--cycle); draw((0,0,0)--(0,2,0)); draw((0,2,0)--(0,0,3)); //EFGH draw((0.5,0,1.5)--(0.5,0,0)--(0,1,0)--(0,1,1.5)--(0.5,0,1.5),red); //Points label(\"$E$\",(0.5,0,1.5),NW); label(\"$F$\",(0.5,0,0),S); label(\"$G$\",(0,1,0),S); label(\"$H$\",(0,1,1.5),NE); label(\"$A$\",(0,0,0),NE); label(\"$B$\",(1,0,0),S); label(\"$C$\",(0,2,0),S); label(\"$D$\",(0,0,3),N); [/asy]",
    "Solution 2": "Computing the points of $EFGH$ gives $E(0.5, 0, 1.5), F(0.5, 0, 0), G(0,1,0), H(0,1,1.5)$.  The vector $EF$ is $(0,0,-1.5)$, while the vector $HG$ is also $(0,0,-1.5)$, meaning the two sides $EF$ and $GH$ are parallel.  Similarly, the vector $FG$ is $(-0.5, 1, 0)$, while the vector $EH$ is also $(-0.5, 1, 0)$.  Again, these are equal in both magnitude and direction, so $FG$ and $EH$ are parallel.  Thus, figure $EFGH$ is a parallelogram.\nComputation of vectors $EF$ and $HG$ is sufficient evidence that the figure is a parallelogram, since the vectors are not only point in the same direction, but are of the same magnitude, but the other vector $FG$ is needed to find the angle between the sides.\nTaking the dot product of vector $EF$ and vector $FG$ gives $0 \\cdot -0.5 + 0 \\cdot 1 + -1.5 \\cdot 0 = 0$, which means the two vectors are perpendicular.  (Alternately, as above, note that vector $EF$ goes directly down on the z-axis, while vector $FG$ has no z-component and lie completely in the xy plane.)  Thus, the figure is a parallelogram with a right angle, which makes it a rectangle.  With the distance formula in three dimensions, we find that $EF = \\frac{3}{2}$ and $FG = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, giving an area of $\\frac32 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{4}}$"
