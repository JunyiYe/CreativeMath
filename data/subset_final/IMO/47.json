  "problem": "Consider a plane $\\epsilon$ and three non-collinear points $A,B,C$ on the same side of $\\epsilon$; suppose the plane determined by these three points is not parallel to $\\epsilon$. In plane $\\epsilon$ take three arbitrary points $A',B',C'$. Let $L,M,N$ be the midpoints of segments $AA', BB', CC'$; Let $G$ be the centroid of the triangle $LMN$. (We will not consider positions of the points $A', B', C'$ such that the points $L,M,N$ do not form a triangle.) What is the locus of point $G$ as $A', B', C'$ range independently over the plane $\\epsilon$?",
  "solutions": {
    "Solution": "We will consider the various points in terms of their coordinates in space.  We have $L=\\frac{A+A^\\prime}{2},M=\\frac{B+B^\\prime}{2},N=\\frac{C+C^\\prime}{2}$.  Since the centroid of a triangle is the average of the triangle's vertices, we have $G=\\frac{1}{3}\\left(L+M+N\\right)=\\frac{1}{6}\\left(A+B+C+A^\\prime+B^\\prime+C^\\prime\\right)$.  It is clear now that $G$ is midpoint of the line segment connecting the centroid of $ABC$ and the centroid of $A^\\prime B^\\prime C^\\prime$.  It is obvious that the centroid of $A^\\prime B^\\prime C^\\prime$ can be any point on plane $\\epsilon$.  Thus, the locus of $G$ is the plane parallel to $\\epsilon$ and halfway between the centroid of $ABC$ and $\\epsilon$."
