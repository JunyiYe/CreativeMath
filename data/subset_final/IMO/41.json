  "problem": "Find all functions $f$ defined on the set of positive reals which take positive real values and satisfy the conditions:  \n(i)   $f(xf(y))=yf(x)$ for all $x,y$; \n(ii)  $f(x)\\to0$ as $x\\to \\infty$.",
  "solutions": {
    "Solution 1": "Let $x=y=1$ and we have $f(f(1))=f(1)$.  Now, let $x=1,y=f(1)$ and we have $f(f(f(1)))=f(1)f(1)\\Rightarrow f(1)=[f(1)]^2$ since $f(1)>0$ we have $f(1)=1$.  \nPlug in $y=x$ and we have $f(xf(x))=xf(x)$.  If $a=1$ is the only solution to $f(a)=a$ then we have $xf(x)=1\\Rightarrow f(x)=\\frac{1}{x}$.  We prove that this is the only function by showing that there does not exist any other $a$:\nSuppose there did exist such an $a\\ne1$.  Then, letting $y=a$ in the functional equation yields $f(xa)=af(x)$.  Then, letting $x=\\frac{1}{a}$ yields $f(\\frac{1}{a})=\\frac{1}{a}$.  Notice that since $a\\ne1$, one of $a,\\frac{1}{a}$ is greater than $1$.  Let $b$ equal the one that is greater than $1$.  Then, we find similarly (since $f(b)=b$) that $f(xb)=bf(x)$.  Putting $x=b$ into the equation, yields $f(b^2)=b^2$.  Repeating this process we find that $f(b^{2^k})=b^{2^k}$ for all natural $k$.  But, since $b>1$, as $k\\to \\infty$, we have that $b^{2^k}\\to\\infty$ which contradicts the fact that $f(x)\\to0$ as $x\\to \\infty$.",
    "Solution 2": "Let $x=1$ so \\[f(f(y))=yf(1).\\]  If $f(a)=f(b),$  then $af(1)=f(f(a))=f(f(b))=bf(1)\\implies a=b$ because $f(1)$ goes to the real positive integers, not $0.$  Hence, $f$ is injective.  Let $x=y$ so \n\\[f(xf(x))=xf(x)\\] so $xf(x)$ is a fixed point of $f.$ Then, let $y=1$ so $f(xf(1))=f(x)\\implies f(1)=1$ as $x$ can't be $0$ so $1$ is a fixed point of $f.$  We claim $1$ is the only fixed point of $f.$ Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $a,b$ be fixed points of $f$ so $f(a)=a$ and $f(b)=b.$  Then, setting $x=a,y=b$ in (i) gives \\[f(ab)=f(af(b))=bf(a)=ab\\] so $ab$ is also a fixed point of $f.$ Also, let $x=\\frac{1}{a},y=a$ so \\[1=f(1)=f(\\frac{1}{a}\\cdot a)=f(\\frac{1}{a}\\cdot f(a))=af(\\frac{1}{a})\\implies f(\\frac{1}{a})=\\frac{1}{a}\\] so $\\frac{1}{a}$ is a fixed point of $f.$ If $f(a)=a$ with $a>1,$ then $f(a^n)$ is a fixed point of $f$, contradicting (ii).  If $f(a)=a$ with $0<a<1,$ then $f(\\frac{1}{a^n})=\\frac{1}{a^n}$ so $\\frac{1}{a^n}$ is a fixed point, contradicting (ii).  Hence, the only fixed point is $1$ so $xf(x)=1$ so $f(x)=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{x}}$ and we can easily check that this solution works."
