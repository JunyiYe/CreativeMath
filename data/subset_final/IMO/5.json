        "Solution 1": "I shall prove a more general statement about the unit distance graph($V=\\mathbb{R}^2$, adjacency iff the Euclidean distance between the points is $1$) and this will follow as a consequence.\nif $G,H$ occur as unit distance graphs, then so does $G\\times H$( here $G\\times H$ is described as $V(G\\times H)=V(G)\\times V(H), (v_1,w_1)\\leftrightarrow (v_2,w_2) \\Leftrightarrow v_1=v_2,w_1\\leftrightarrow w_2$ or $v_1\\leftrightarrow v_2,w_1=w_2$).\nthis is seen by describing the vertices by complex numbers. suppose there is an embedding of $G$ by the complex numbers $v_1,v_2\\ldots,v_n$ and for $H$ by the numbers $w_1,w_2,\\ldots, w_m$. we claim that for some choice of $0\\leq\\theta<2\\pi$, $v_i+e^{i\\theta}w_j$ will do the job(a suitable rotation).\nwhat we need is that $(v_i+e^{i\\theta}w_j)\\leftrightarrow (v_k+e^{i\\theta}w_l)$ iff either $v_i=v_k,|w_j-w_l|=1$ or $w_j=w_l,|v_i-v_k|=1$. clearly if the condition holds then the adjacency is satisfied. suppose $i\\neq k,j\\neq l$ and that the corresponding complex numbers are at a distance $1$ from one another. Then this gives a quadratic in $e^{i\\theta}$ and hence $\\theta$ can take only finitely many values here.ruling this out for each such set of $i,j,k,l$ hence rules out finitely many values of $\\theta$ and therefore a suitable choice exists.\nfor the given problem we need a unit distance graph which is regular of degree $m$ for any given $m$. since we can form the graph $K_2$, we can form $Q_n=Q_{n-1}\\times K_2$(the unit cube) and that solves the problem.\n\n\nThis solution was posted and copyrighted by seshadri.

        "Solution 2": "Suppose $S$ has the form\\[S_m=\\left\\{\\sum_{\\mathbf v \\in U} \\mathbf v \\;\\middle\\vert\\; U \\subseteq V_m\\right\\}=\\left\\{\\sum_{i=1}^m b_i \\mathbf v_i \\;\\middle\\vert\\; b_i \\in \\{0,1\\}\\right\\}\\!,\\]where $V_m=\\{\\mathbf v_1,\\mathbf v_2,\\dots,\\mathbf v_m\\}$ is unknown set of distinct unit vectors in $\\mathbb R^2$. We can build $V_m$ inductively, starting from the empty set and adding vectors to it, one by one. We just need to make sure that two thing are respected:\n1. All $2^m$ vectors in $S_m$ are distinct;\n2. Two vector sums are at unit distance from one another if and only if they differ in presence of exactly one summand (i.e. one and only one coefficient $b_i$ in the sum changes from $0$ to $1$).\nIf these two conditions are kept, then each of $2^m$ points at $S_m$ will be at unit distance from exactly $m$ points corresponding to sums at which one and only one of $m$ coefficients differs from coefficients of this point. However, respecting these conditions is not hard because $\\left\\|\\sum_{\\mathbf v \\in U_1} \\mathbf v - \\sum_{\\mathbf v \\in U_2} \\mathbf v\\right\\|=\\left\\|\\sum_{\\mathbf v \\in U_1 \\setminus U_2} \\mathbf v \\,-\\! \\sum_{\\mathbf v \\in U_2 \\setminus U_1} \\mathbf v\\right\\|$ and for each new vector being added to $V_m$ there is at most some finite set of forbidden endpoints given by sums/differences of already determined vectors but the rest of the (infinite) unit circle is permissible.\n\n\nThis solution was posted and copyrighted by Bandera.
