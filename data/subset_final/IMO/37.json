    "Solution": "Answer: The unique solution is the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\) for every \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R}^+ \\). This function clearly satisfies the required property since the expression \\( xf(y) + yf(x) = \\frac{x}{y} + \\frac{y}{x} \\) is greater than 2 for every \\( y \\neq x \\) (directly from AM-GM) and equal to 2 (with equality) for the unique value \\( y = x \\).\nProof: Let's consider a solution based on some ideas we encountered in the preparation classes for the Olympiad, specifically involving auxiliary sets and functions with specific properties.\nThe fact that for every \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R}^+ \\), there exists a unique \\( y \\in \\mathbb{R}^+ \\) that satisfies the equation \\( xf(y) + yf(x) \\leq 2 \\) can be equivalently expressed as follows: there exists a well-defined function \\( g: \\mathbb{R}^+ \\to \\mathbb{R}^+ \\) given by \\( g(x)\u00a0:= y \\), where \\( y \\) is the one mentioned above. The well-definedness of this function is evident due to the existence and uniqueness, and it satisfies the equation \\( P(x): \\quad xf(g(x)) + f(x)g(x) \\leq 2 \\) while applying the same property for \\( x \\mapsto g(x) \\) gives another unique \\( y\u00a0:= g(g(x)) \\) such that \\( g(x)f(y) + yf(g(x)) \\leq 2 \\). Therefore, we have \\( xf(y) + yf(x) > 2 \\) for all \\( y \\neq g(x) \\).\nSince this inequality holds for \\( y = x \\) (from \\( xf(y) + yf(x) > 2 \\)), the uniqueness assumption implies that \\( g(g(x)) = x \\), making \\( g \\) an involution (hence bijective).\nGenerally, working with an involution naturally leads us to consider its fixed points, especially since we aim to show that \\( g(x) = x \\) identically (which holds for the solution \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}\\)). Let's define the set of fixed points of \\( g \\) as \\( \\mathcal{S}\u00a0:= \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^+ \\mid g(x) = x \\} \\) and show that \\( \\mathcal{S} = \\mathbb{R}^+ \\) is the entire domain.\nAssume for a contradiction that some \\( x \\notin \\mathcal{S} \\) is not a fixed point, i.e., \\( x \\neq g(x) \\). Then, the inequality \\( 2xf(x) > 2 \\) (derived from \\( y \\mapsto x \\)) holds, implying \\( f(x) > \\frac{1}{x} \\). Similarly, \\( x \\notin \\mathcal{S} \\) implies \\( g(x) \\notin \\mathcal{S} \\) (otherwise \\( g(x) \\in \\mathcal{S} \\) implies \\( x = g(g(x)) = g(x) \\), a contradiction), leading to \\( f(g(x)) > \\frac{1}{g(x)} \\).\nApplying these inequalities to \\( P(x) \\) gives \\( xf(g(x)) + f(x)g(x) < 2 \\), which is clearly a contradiction as \\( \\frac{x}{g(x)} + \\frac{g(x)}{x} \\geqslant 2 \\), e.g., from the AM-GM inequality. Therefore, we must have \\( x \\in \\mathcal{S} \\) for every \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R}^+ \\), i.e., \\( g(x) = x \\).\nSubstituting this relationship into the original equation, we obtain \\( P(x): \\quad xf(x) + f(x)x \\leq 2 \\implies xf(x) \\leq 1 \\implies f(x) \\leq \\frac{1}{x} \\) for every \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R}^+ \\). Applying \\( yf(y) \\leq 1 \\) to the equation \\( xf(y) + yf(x) > 2 \\) (since \\( g(x) = x \\)) yields \\( f(x) > \\frac{2}{y} - \\frac{x}{y^2} \\), and taking the limit \\( y \\to x \\) from either side results in \\( f(x) \\geq \\frac{1}{x} \\).\nCombining the results, we have \\( f(x) \\leq \\frac{1}{x} \\) and \\( f(x) \\geq \\frac{1}{x} \\), implying \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\) as desired. \\(\\blacksquare\\)\n."
