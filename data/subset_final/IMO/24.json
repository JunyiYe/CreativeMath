    "solutions": {
        "Solution 1": "Let the decimal expansion of $x$ be $\\overline{d_1d_2d_3\\dots d_n}$, where $d_i$ are base-10 digits. We then have that $x\\geq d_1\\cdot 10^{n-1}$. However, the product of the digits of $x$ is $d_1d_2d_3\\dots d_n\\leq d_1\\cdot 10\\cdot 10\\dots 10=d_1\\cdot 10^{n-1}$, with equality only when $x$ is a one-digit integer. Therefore the product of the digits of $x$ is always at most $x$, with equality only when $x$ is a base-10 digit. This implies that $x^2-10x-22\\leq x$, so $x^2-11x-22\\leq 0$. Every natural number from 1 to 12 satisfies this inequality, so we only need to check these possibilities. It is easy to rule out 1 through 11, since $x^2-10x-22<0$ for those values. However, $12^2-10\\cdot 12-22=2$, which is the product of the digits of 12. Therefore $\\boxed{12}$ is the only natural number with the desired properties. $\\blacksquare$\n\n\n",
        "Solution 2(SFFT)": "It is pretty obvious that $x$ cannot be three digits or more, because then $x^2 - 10x - 22$ is way too big.\n\n\nWrite $x = 10a + b$ where $a$ and $b$ are digits satisfying $0 \\leq a, b < 10$. Then, we can use SFFT:\n\\[(10a + b)^2 - 10(10a + b) - 22 = ab\\]\n\\[(10a + b)^2 - 10(10a + b) - 24 = ab - 2\\]\n\\[(10a + b + 2)(10a + b - 12) = ab - 2.\\]\nWe have\n\\[(10a + b + 2)(10a + b - 12) \\geq (10a + 2)(10a - 12) = 100a^2 - 100a + 24 = 100(a^2 - a) + 24.\\]\nIt is therefore clear that $a$ must be either $0$ or $1$. We can then split into two cases:\n\n\n$\\mathbf{a = 0:}$\n\n\nWe have $(b + 2)(b - 12) = -2$ or $b^2 - 10b - 22 = 0$, which is only satisfied when $b = -2$ or $12$.\n\n\n$\\mathbf{a = 1:}$\n\n\nWe have $(b + 12)(b - 2) = b - 2$. This is only satisfied when $b = 2$, or $b + 12 = 0$. Therefore, $b = 2$, and so $x = \\boxed{12}.\\square$\n\n\n~mathboy100\n\n\n",
        "Solution 3": "Let, \n$x^2-10x-22=y$\n\n\n$\\implies x^2-10+25-47=y$\n\n\n$\\implies (x-5)^2=47+y$\n\n\nNow note that, if $p$ is a prime such that $p|y$ then $7\\geq p$.\n\n\nThat means, $y=2^a*3^b*5^c*7^d$\n\n\nBut, $a^2 \\not\\equiv 2 (mod3), a^2 \\not\\equiv 2 (mod5), a^2 \\not\\equiv 5 (mod7)$ which means $3,5,7$ don't divivde $(x-5)^2-47=y.$\n\n\nSo, $y=2^a$ and $y+17=2^a+47=(x-5)^2$\n\n\nIt is easy to see that $a$ has one solution  and that is $2.$( Prove it by contradiction)\n\n\nSo, $(x-5)^2=47+2=49$\n\n\n$\\implies x=12$\n\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n\n"
