  "solutions": {
    "Solution": "Since $cos^2x + sin^2x = 1$, we cannot have solutions with $n\\ne2$ and $0<|cos(x)|,|sin(x)|<1$. Nor can we have solutions with $n=2$, because the sign is wrong. So the only solutions have $sin (x) = 0$ or $cos (x) = 0$, and these are: $x =$ multiple of $\\pi$, and $n$ even; $x$ even multiple of $\\pi$ and $n$ odd; $x$ = even multiple of $\\pi + \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ and $n$ odd."
