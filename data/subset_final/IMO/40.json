    "Solution": "Let $f(n)$ and $g(j)$ be functions of positive integers $n$ and $j$ respectively.\nLet $a_{n}=a_{1}+f(n)$, then $a_{n+1}=a_{1}+f(n+1)$, and $a_{n+k}=a_{1}+f(n+k)$\nLet $P=\\prod_{j=1}^{k}\\left ( a_{n+j} \\right ) = \\prod_{j=1}^{k}\\left ( a_{n}+g(j)) \\right )$\nIf we want the coefficients of $P(a_{n})$ to be positive, then $g(j)\\geq 0$ for all $j$ which will give the following value for $P$:\n$P=a_{n}^{k}+C_{k-1}a_{n}^{k-1}+...+C_{1}a_{n}+\\prod_{j=1}^{k} g(j) = P(a_{n})$\nThus for every $j$ and $n$ we need the following:\n$a_{n}+g(j)=a_{n+j}=a_{1}+f(n+j)$\nSolving for $g(j)$ we get:\n$g(j)=a_{1}+f(n+j)-a_{n}=a_{1}+f(n+j)-a_{1}-f(n)$\n$g(j)=f(n+j)-f(n)\\geq 0$ for all $n$ and $j$ because $g(j)$ needs to be greater than or equal to zero for all coefficients to be non-negative.\nThis means that $f(n)$ needs to be increasing with $n$, or staying constant, and also with $f(1)=0$ because $a_{1}=a_{1}+f(1)$.\nIn addition, since we need all coefficients to be integer, then all $f(n)$ and $g(j)$ must also be integers.  We also need $g(j)$ to not be dependent of $n$, so in the expression $f(n+j)-f(n)$, the $n$ needs to cancel.  This mean that the rate of change for $f(n)$ with respect to $n$ needs to be constant.  This can only be achieved with $f(n)$ be the equation of a line with slope being either zero or positive integer.\nSo, we set $f(n)$ to be the equation of a line as $f(n)=mn+b$ with $m$ being the slope with a non-negative value and with $b$ the intercept at $n=0$.  We know that $f(1)=0$ so $f(1)=m+b=0$ which means that $b=-m$ and our function becomes $f(n)=mn-m=(n-1)m$. Since $f(n)$ needs to be non-negative integer then $m\\geq 0 \\mid m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ then $f(n)$ is increasing or constant, with $f(1)=0$\nThen, $g(j)=f(n+j)-f(n)=(n+j-1)m-(n-1)m=jm$\nThis gives:\n$\\prod_{j=1}^{k}\\left ( a_{n}+jm \\right )=P(a_{n})=a_{n}^{k}+C_{k-1}a_{n}^{k-1}+...+C_{1}a_{n}+k!m^{k}$\nwith $C_{0}=k!m^{k}$ and coefficients of polynomial $\\geq 0$\nThen, $a_{n}=a_{1}+f(n)$\nWhich provides the solution of all infinite sequences of positive integers as:\n$a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1)m$, $\\forall m\\geq 0 \\mid m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $a_{1} \\geq 1 \\mid a_{1} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$"
