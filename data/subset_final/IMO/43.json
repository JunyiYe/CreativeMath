        "Solution": "First of all note that we have $(q + 1)^q - 1$ possible nonzero vectors $(x_1,\\cdots,x_q)$ such that $0\\leq x_i\\leq q$ are integers.\n\n\n\n\nBut $a_{j1}x_1 + \\cdots + a_{jq}x_q$ can only assume $q^2 + 1$ different values, because if it is maximized/minimized by $(M_1,M_2,\\cdots,M_q)/(m_1,m_2,\\cdots,m_q)$, we have that $\\sum_{i = 1}^{q}a_{ji}(M_i - m_i)\\leq q\\times q = q^2$ (if $a_{ji} = 0$, it doesn't affect the sum, if it is $1$, $M_i = q,m_i = 0$, and if it is $- 1$, $M_i = 0,m_i = q$).\n\n\n\n\nFrom this we conclude that there are at most $(q^2 + 1)^p = (q^2 + 1)^{q/2}$ possible values for the vector $(a_{11}x_{1} + \\ldots + a_{1q}x_{q},\\cdots,a_{p1}x_{1} + \\ldots + a_{pq}x_{q})$.\nBut we have that:\n$(q + 1)^q - 1 = (q^2 + 1 + 2q)^{q/2} - 1 =$\n$= (q^2 + 1)^{q/2} + \\left( - 1 + \\sum_{j = 1}^{q/2}{{q/2}\\choose j}(q^2 + 1)^{q/2 - j}(2q)^j\\right) > (q^2 + 1)^{q/2}$\n\n\nWe conclude that by the pigeonhole principle there are two distinct vectors being mapped to the same vector. Taking their difference we have a vector with the desired properties.\n\n\nThe above solution was posted and copyrighted by Jorge Miranda.
