  "problem": "In triangle $ABC$, point $A_1$ lies on side $BC$ and point $B_1$ lies on side $AC$. Let $P$ and $Q$ be points on segments $AA_1$ and $BB_1$, respectively, such that $PQ$ is parallel to $AB$. Let $P_1$ be a point on line $PB_1$, such that $B_1$ lies strictly between $P$ and $P_1$, and $\\angle PP_1C=\\angle BAC$. Similarly, let $Q_1$ be the point on line $QA_1$, such that $A_1$ lies strictly between $Q$ and $Q_1$, and $\\angle CQ_1Q=\\angle CBA$.\nProve that points $P,Q,P_1$, and $Q_1$ are concyclic.",

    "Solution": "The essence of the proof is to build a circle through the points $P, Q,$ and two additional points $A_0$ and $B_0,$ then we prove that the points $P_1$ and $Q_1$ lie on the same circle.\nWe assume that the intersection point of $AP$ and $BQ$ lies on the segment $PA_1.$ If it lies on segment $AP,$ then the proof is the same, but some angles will be replaced with additional ones up to $180^\\circ$.\nLet the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABC$ be $\\Omega$. Let $A_0$ and $B_0$ be the points of intersection of $AP$ and $BQ$ with $\\Omega$. Let $\\angle BAP = \\delta.$\n\\[PQ||AB \\implies \\angle QPA_0 = \\delta.\\]\n$\\angle BAP = \\angle BB_0A_0 = \\delta$ since they intersept the arc $BA_0$ of the circle $\\Omega$.\n$\\angle QPA_0 = \\angle QB_0A_0 \\implies QPB_0A_0$ is cyclic (in circle $\\omega.$)\nLet $\\angle BAC = \\alpha, \\angle AA_0B_0 = \\varphi.$\n$\\angle PP_1C = \\alpha, \\angle BB_0C = \\alpha$ since they intersept the arc $BC$ of the circle $\\Omega.$\nSo $B_0P_1CB_1$ is cyclic.\n$\\angle ACB_0 = \\angle AA_0B_0 =  \\varphi$ (they intersept the arc $A_0B_0$ of the circle  $\\Omega).$\n$\\angle B_1CB_0 = \\varphi.$\n$\\angle B_1P_1B_0 = \\angle B_1CB_0 =  \\varphi$ (since they intersept the arc $B_1B_0$ of the circle $B_0P_1CB_1).$\nHence $\\angle PA_0B_0 = \\angle PP_1B_0 = \\varphi,$  the point $P_1$ lies on $\\omega.$\nSimilarly, point $Q_1$ lies on  $\\omega.$"
