    "problem": "Ten tiles numbered $1$ through $10$ are turned face down. One tile is turned up at random, and a die is rolled. What is the probability that the product of the numbers on the tile and the die will be a square?\n\n\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac{1}{10}\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\frac{1}{6}\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac{11}{60}\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac{1}{5}\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\frac{7}{30}$",

        "Solution": "The numbers can at most multiply to be $60$. The squares less than $60$ are $1,4,9,16,25,36,$ and $49$. The possible pairs are $(1,1),(1,4),(2,2),(4,1),(3,3),(9,1),(4,4),(8,2),(5,5),(6,6),$ and $(9,4)$. There are $11$ choices and $60$ possibilities giving a probability of $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac{11}{60}}$."
