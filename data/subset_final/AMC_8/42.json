  "problem": "The top of one tree is $16$ feet higher than the top of another tree. The heights of the two trees are in the ratio $3:4$. In feet, how tall is the taller tree? \n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 48 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 64 \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 80 \\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 96\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 112$",
  "solutions": {
    "Solution 1(algebra solution)": "Let the height of the taller tree be $h$ and let the height of the smaller tree be $h-16$. Since the ratio of the smaller tree to the larger tree is $\\frac{3}{4}$, we have $\\frac{h-16}{h}=\\frac{3}{4}$. Solving for $h$ gives us $h=64 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 64}$",
    "Solution 2": "To answer this problem, you have to make it so that we have the same proportion as 3:4, but the difference between them is 16. Since the two numbers are consecutive, if we multiply both of them by 16, we would get a difference of 16 between them. So, it would be 48:64 and since we need to find the height of the taller tree, we get $h=64 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 64}$"
