    "problem": "Susan had 50 dollars to spend at the carnival. She spent 12 dollars on food and twice as much on rides. How many dollars did she have left to spend?\n\n\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 12 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 14 \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 26 \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 38 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 50$\n\n\n",

        "Solution": "If Susan spent 12 dollars, then twice that much on rides, then she spent $12+12 \\times 2=36$ dollars in total. We subtract $36$ from $50$ to get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 14}$\n\n\n"
