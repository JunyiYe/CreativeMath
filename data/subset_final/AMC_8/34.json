    "problem": "The Little Twelve Basketball Conference has two divisions, with six teams in each division. Each team plays each of the other teams in its own division twice and every team in the other division once. How many conference games are scheduled?\n\n\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 80\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 96\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 100\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 108\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 192$",
    "solutions": {
        "Solution": "Within each division, there are $\\binom {6}{2} = 15$ pairings, and each of these games happens twice. The same goes for the other division so that there are $4(15)=60$ games within their own divisions. The number of games between the two divisions is $(6)(6)=36$. Together there are $60+36=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 96}$ conference games.",
        "Solution 2": "Each team plays 10 games in its own division and 6 games against teams in the other division. So each of the 12 teams plays 16 conference games. Because each game involves two teams, there are $\\frac{12\\times 16}{2}=\\boxed{96}$ games scheduled."
