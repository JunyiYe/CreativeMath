    "problem": "Abby, Bret, Carl, and Dana are seated in a row of four seats numbered #1 to #4.  Joe looks at them and says:\n\n\n\\begin{verbatim}\n\"Bret is next to Carl.\"\n\"Abby is between Bret and Carl.\"\n\\end{verbatim}\nHowever each one of Joe's statements is false.  Bret is actually sitting in seat #3.  Who is sitting in seat #2?\n\n\n$\\text{(A)}\\ \\text{Abby} \\qquad \\text{(B)}\\ \\text{Bret} \\qquad \\text{(C)}\\ \\text{Carl} \\qquad \\text{(D)}\\ \\text{Dana} \\qquad \\text{(E)}\\ \\text{There is not enough information to be sure.}$",

        "Solution": "\\[\\text{-----}\\qquad \\text{-----} \\qquad \\text{Bret} \\qquad \\text{-----}\\]\n\n\nWe know that Carl does not sit next to Bret, so he must sit in seat #1.  Since Abby is not between Bret and Carl, she must sit in seat #4.  Finally, Dana has to take the last seat available, which is #2.\n\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{D}}$"
