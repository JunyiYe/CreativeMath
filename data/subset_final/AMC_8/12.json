  "problem": "Half the people in a room left.  One third of those remaining started to dance.  There were then $12$ people who were not dancing.  The original number of people in the room was\n$\\text{(A)}\\ 24 \\qquad \\text{(B)}\\ 30 \\qquad \\text{(C)}\\ 36 \\qquad \\text{(D)}\\ 42 \\qquad \\text{(E)}\\ 72$",

    "Solution": "Let the original number of people in the room be $x$.  Half of them left, so $\\frac{x}{2}$ of them are left in the room.\nAfter that, one third of this group is dancing, so $\\frac{x}{2}-\\frac{1}{3}\\left( \\frac{x}{2}\\right) =\\frac{x}{3}$ people are not dancing.\nThis is given to be $12$, so \\[\\frac{x}{3}=12\\Rightarrow x=36\\]\n$\\boxed{\\text{C}}$",
    "Solution #2": "First note that of the $\\frac{1}{2}$ people remaining in the room, $\\frac{2}{3}$ are not dancing. Therefore $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}= \\frac{1}{3}$ of the original amount of people in the room is $12$. The answer is $\\boxed{C}$."
