  "problem": "There are 24 four-digit whole numbers that use each of the four digits 2, 4, 5 and 7 exactly once. Only one of these four-digit numbers is a multiple of another one. Which of the following is it?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 5724 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 7245 \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 7254 \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 7425 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 7542$",

    "Solution": "We begin by narrowing down the possibilities. If the larger number were twice the smaller number, then the smallest possibility for the larger number is $2457\\times2=4914$, since $2457$ is the smallest number in the set. The largest possibility would have to be twice the largest number in the set such that when it is multiplied by $2$, it is less than or equal to $7542$, the largest number in the set. This happens to be $2754\\times2=5508$. Therefore, the number would have to be between $4914$ and $5508$, and also even. The only even numbers in the set and in this range are $5472$ and $5274$. A quick check reveals that neither of these numbers is twice a number in the set. The number can't be quadruple or more another number in the set since $2457\\times4=9828$, well past the range of the set. Therefore, the number must be triple another number in the set. The least possibility is $2457\\times3=7371$ and the greatest is $2475\\times3=7425$, since any higher number in the set multiplied by $3$ would be out of the range of the set. Reviewing, we find that the upper bound does in fact work, so the multiple is $2475\\times3=7425, \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}}$\n\nOr, since the greatest number possible divided by the smallest number possible is slightly greater than 3, divide all of the choices by 2, then 3 and see if the resulting answer contains 2,4,5 and 7. Doing so, you find that $7425/3 = 2475,  \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}}$",
    "Solution 2": "There are only 5 options for the problem so we can just try them. It is easy since that we only need try to use $2$, $3$ to divide them. Even $5$ will leads to a solution start with $1$ which we don't need.\n$5724/2=2862$, $5724/3=1908$. $7245/3=2415$. $7254/2=3612$, $7254/3=2418$. $7425/3=2475$. The answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}}$. You can obtain the answer in only 6 calculations."
