        "Solution": "Draw a square circumscribed around the circle.  (Alternately, the circle is inscribed in the square.)  If the circle has radius $4$, it has diameter $8$.  Two of the diameters of the circle will run parallel to the sides of the square.  Thus, the smallest square that contains it has side length $8$, and area $8\\times8=64$.\n$\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}}$"
