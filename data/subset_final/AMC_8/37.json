    "problem": "A board game spinner is divided into three regions labeled $A$, $B$ and $C$. The probability of the arrow stopping on region $A$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$ and on region $B$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$. The probability of the arrow stopping on region $C$ is:\n\n\n\n\n$\\text{(A)}\\ \\frac{1}{12}\\qquad\\text{(B)}\\ \\frac{1}{6}\\qquad\\text{(C)}\\ \\frac{1}{5}\\qquad\\text{(D)}\\ \\frac{1}{3}\\qquad\\text{(E)}\\ \\frac{2}{5}$",
    "solutions": {
        "Solution": "Since the arrow must land in one of the three regions, the sum of the probabilities must be 1. Thus the answer is $1-\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{3}=\\boxed{\\text{(B)}\\ \\frac16}$."
