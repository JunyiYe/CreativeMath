        "Solution 1": "We have that $(x^2-5)^2 = 16$ if and only if $x^2-5 = \\pm 4$. If $x^2-5 = 4$, then $x^2 = 9 \\implies x = \\pm 3$, giving 2 solutions. If $x^2-5 = -4$, then $x^2 = 1 \\implies x = \\pm 1$, giving 2 more solutions. All four of these solutions work, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }4}$. Further, the equation is a quartic in $x$, so by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, there can be at most four real solutions.\n\n\n",
        "Solution 2": "We can expand $(x^2-5)^2$ to get $x^4-10x^2+25$, so now our equation is $x^4-10x^2+25=16$. Subtracting $16$ from both sides gives us $x^4-10x^2+9=0$. Now, we can factor the left hand side to get $(x^2-9)(x^2-1)=0$. If $x^2-9$ and/or $x^2-1$ equals $0$, then the whole left side will equal $0$. Since the solutions can be both positive and negative, we have $4$ solutions: $-3,3,-1,1$ (we can find these solutions by setting $x^2-9$ and $x^2-1$ equal to $0$ and solving for $x$). So, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }4}$. \n\n\n~UnstoppableGoddess \n\n\n",
