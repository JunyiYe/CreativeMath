Which statement best describes the sale price of an item?\n\n\n$\\text{(A)}\\ \\text{The sale price is }5\\% \\text{ higher than the original price.}$\n\n\n$\\text{(B)}\\ \\text{The sale price is higher than the original price, but by less than }5\\% .$\n\n\n$\\text{(C)}\\ \\text{The sale price is higher than the original price, but by more than }5\\% .$\n\n\n$\\text{(D)}\\ \\text{The sale price is lower than the original price.}$\n\n\n$\\text{(E)}\\ \\text{The sale price is the same as the original price.}$\n\n\n",
