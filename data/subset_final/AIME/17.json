    "problem": "Let $x_1, x_2, ... , x_6$ be non-negative real numbers such that $x_1 +x_2 +x_3 +x_4 +x_5 +x_6 =1$, and $x_1 x_3 x_5 +x_2 x_4 x_6 \\ge {\\frac{1}{540}}$. Let $p$ and $q$ be positive relatively prime integers such that $\\frac{p}{q}$ is the maximum possible value of\n$x_1 x_2 x_3 + x_2 x_3 x_4 +x_3 x_4 x_5 +x_4 x_5 x_6 +x_5 x_6 x_1 +x_6 x_1 x_2$.

        "Solution 1": "Note that neither the constraint nor the expression we need to maximize involves products $x_i x_j$ with $i \\equiv j \\pmod 3$. Factoring out say $x_1$ and $x_4$ we see that the constraint is $x_1(x_3x_5) + x_4(x_2x_6) \\ge {\\frac1{540}}$, while the expression we want to maximize is $x_1(x_2x_3 + x_5x_6 + x_6x_2) + x_4(x_2x_3 + x_5x_6 + x_3x_5)$. Adding the left side of the constraint to the expression, we get: $(x_1 + x_4)(x_2x_3 + x_5x_6 + x_6x_2 + x_3x_5) = (x_1 + x_4)(x_2 + x_5)(x_3 + x_6)$. This new expression is the product of three non-negative terms whose sum is equal to 1. By AM-GM this product is at most $\\frac1{27}$. Since we have added at least $\\frac{1}{540}$ the desired maximum is at most $\\frac1{27} - \\frac1{540} =\\frac{19}{540}$. It is easy to see that this upper bound can in fact be achieved by ensuring that the constraint expression is equal to $\\frac1{540}$ with $x_1 + x_4 = x_2 + x_5 = x_3 + x_6 =\\frac13$—for example, by choosing $x_1$ and $x_2$ small enough—so our answer is $540 + 19 = \\fbox{559}.$\n\n\nAn example is:\n\\begin{align*} x_3 &= x_6 = \\frac16 \\\\ x_1 &= x_2 = \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{20}}{30} \\\\ x_5 &= x_4 = \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{20}}{30} \\end{align*}\n\n\nAnother example is \n\\begin{align*} x_1 = x_3 = \\frac{1}{3} \\\\ x_2 = \\frac{19}{60}, \\ x_5 = \\frac{1}{60} \\\\ x_4 &= x_6 = 0 \\end{align*}\n\n",
        "Solution 2 (Not legit)": "There's a symmetry between $x_1, x_3, x_5$ and $x_2,x_4,x_6$. Therefore, a good guess is that $a = x_1 = x_3 = x_5$ and $b = x_2 = x_4 = x_6$, at which point we know that $a+b = 1/3$, $a^3+b^3 \\geq 1/540$, and we are trying to maximize $3a^2b+3ab^2$. Then,\n\n\n\\[3a^2b+3ab^2 = (a+b)^3-a^3-b^3 \\leq \\frac{1}{27} - \\frac{1}{540} = \\boxed{\\frac{19}{540}}\\] which is the answer.\n\n\nThis solution is extremely lucky; if you attempt to solve for $a$ and $b$ you receive complex answers (which contradict the problem statement), but the final answer is correct.\n\n\n"
