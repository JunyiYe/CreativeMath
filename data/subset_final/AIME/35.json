    "problem": "Dave arrives at an airport which has twelve gates arranged in a straight line with exactly $100$ feet between adjacent gates. His departure gate is assigned at random. After waiting at that gate, Dave is told the departure gate has been changed to a different gate, again at random. Let the probability that Dave walks $400$ feet or less to the new gate be a fraction $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\n\n\n",
    "solutions": {
        "Solution 1": "There are $12 \\cdot 11 = 132$ possible situations ($12$ choices for the initially assigned gate, and $11$ choices for which gate Dave's flight was changed to). We are to count the situations in which the two gates are at most $400$ feet apart.\n\n\nIf we number the gates $1$ through $12$, then gates $1$ and $12$ have four other gates within $400$ feet, gates $2$ and $11$ have five, gates $3$ and $10$ have six, gates $4$ and $9$ have have seven, and gates $5$, $6$, $7$, $8$ have eight. Therefore, the number of valid gate assignments is \\[2\\cdot(4+5+6+7)+4\\cdot8 = 2 \\cdot 22 + 4 \\cdot 8 = 76\\] so the probability is $\\frac{76}{132} = \\frac{19}{33}$. The answer is $19 + 33 = \\boxed{052}$.\n\n",
        "Solution 2": "As before, derive that there are $132$ possibilities for Dave's original and replacement gates.\n\n\nNow suppose that Dave has to walk $100k$ feet to get to his new gate.  This means that Dave's old and new gates must be $k$ gates apart.  (For example, a $100$ foot walk would consist of the two gates being adjacent to each other.)  There are $12-k$ ways to pick two gates which are $k$ gates apart, and $2$ possibilities for gate assignments, for a total of $2(12-k)$ possible assignments for each $k$.\n\n\nAs a result, the total number of valid gate arrangements is \\[2\\cdot 11 + 2\\cdot 10 + 2\\cdot 9 + 2\\cdot 8 = 76\\] and so the requested probability is $\\tfrac{19}{33}$ for a final answer of $\\boxed{052}$.\n\n\n"
