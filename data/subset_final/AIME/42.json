    "problem": "Six congruent circles form a ring with each circle externally tangent to two circles adjacent to it. All circles are internally tangent to a circle $C$ with radius 30. Let $K$ be the area of the region inside circle $C$ and outside of the six circles in the ring. Find $\\lfloor K \\rfloor$ (the floor function).\n\n\n \n\n\n ",

        "Solution": "Define the radii of the six congruent circles as $r$. If we draw all of the radii to the points of external tangency, we get a regular hexagon. If we connect the vertices of the hexagon to the center of the circle $C$, we form several equilateral triangles. The length of each side of the triangle is $2r$. Notice that the radius of circle $C$ is equal to the length of the side of the triangle plus $r$. Thus, the radius of $C$ has a length of $3r = 30$, and so $r = 10$. $K = 30^2\\pi - 6(10^2\\pi) = 300\\pi$, so $\\lfloor 300\\pi \\rfloor = \\boxed{942}$.\n\n\n "
