  "problem": "In tetrahedron $ABCD$, edge $AB$ has length 3 cm. The area of face $ABC$ is $15\\mbox{cm}^2$ and the area of face $ABD$ is $12 \\mbox { cm}^2$. These two faces meet each other at a $30^\\circ$ angle. Find the volume of the tetrahedron in $\\mbox{cm}^3$.",
  "solutions": {
    "Solution 1": "Position face $ABC$ on the bottom. Since $[\\triangle ABD] = 12 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AB \\cdot h_{ABD}$, we find that $h_{ABD} = 8$. Because the problem does not specify, we may assume both $ABC$ and $ABD$ to be isosceles triangles. Thus, the height of $ABD$ forms a $30-60-90$ with the height of the tetrahedron. So, $h = \\frac{1}{2} (8) = 4$. The volume of the tetrahedron is thus $\\frac{1}{3}Bh = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot15 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{020}$.",
    "Solution 2 (Rigorous)": "It is clear that $DX=8$ and $CX=10$ where $X$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $D$ and $C$ to side $AB$. Thus $[DXC]=\\frac{ab\\sin{c}}{2}=20=5 \\cdot h \\rightarrow h = 4$ where h is the height of the tetrahedron from $D$. Hence, the volume of the tetrahedron is $\\frac{bh}{3}=15\\cdot \\frac{4}{3}=\\boxed{020}$\n\n(Note this actually isn't rigorous because they never proved that the height from $D$ to $XC$ is the altitude of the tetrahedron.",
    "Solution 3 (Sketchy)": "Make faces $ABC$ and $ABD$ right triangles. This makes everything a lot easier. Then do everything in solution 1.",
    "Solution 4 (coord/vector bash)": "We can use 3D coordinates.\nLet $A = (0, 0, 0)$ and $B = (3, 0, 0).$ WLOG, let $D = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}, 8, 0\\right)$, because the area of $\\Delta{ABD} = 12$ and the tetrahedron area won't change if we put it somewhere else with $y=8.$\nTo find $C$, we can again let the $x$-coordinate be $\\frac{3}{2}$ for simplicity. Note that $C$ is $10$ units away from $AB$ because the area of $\\Delta{ABC}$ is $15$. Since the angle between $ABD$ and $ABC$ is $30^\\circ$, we can form a 30-60-90 triangle between $A$, $B$, and an altitude dropped from $C$ onto face $ABD$. Since $10$ is the hypotenuse, we get $5\\sqrt{3}$ and $5$ as legs. Then $y=5\\sqrt{3}$ and $z=5$, so $C = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}, 5\\sqrt{3}, 5\\right).$\n(I highly advise you to draw both the tetrahedron and 30-60-90 triangle to get a better perspective.)\nNow, we can move onto vectors. To find the volume of the tetrahedron, we use the formula $\\frac{1}{3}Bh.$ Letting $\\Delta{ABC}$ be the base we have $B = 15$ (from the problem statement). We need to find the distance between $D$ and $ABC$, and to do this, we should find the projection of $D$ onto face $ABC$.\nNote that we can simplify this to projecting $D$ onto $\\mathbf{\\overrightarrow{C}}.$ This is because we know the projection will have the same $x$-coordinate as $D$ and $C$, as both are $\\frac{3}{2}.$ Now we find $\\text{proj}_{\\mathbf{\\overrightarrow{D}}} \\mathbf{\\overrightarrow{C}}$, or plugging in our coordinates, $\\text{proj}_{\\langle\\frac{3}{2}, 5\\sqrt{3}, 5\\rangle} \\left\\langle\\frac{3}{2}, 8, 0\\right\\rangle$. \nLet the $x$-coordinates for both be $0$ for simplicity, because we can always add a $\\frac{3}{2}$ at the end. Using the projection formula, we get \\[\\langle 0, 6, 2\\sqrt{3}\\rangle.\\]\nFinally, we calculate the distance between $\\left(\\frac{3}{2}, 6, 2\\sqrt{3}\\right)$ and $D$ to be $4$. So the height is $4$, and plugging into our tetrahedron formula we get \\[\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot 15\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{20}.\\]"
