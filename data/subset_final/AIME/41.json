  "problem": "Let $P_1^{}$ be a regular polygon and $P_2^{}$ be a regular polygon $(r\\geq s\\geq 3)$ such that each interior angle of $P_1^{}$ is $\\frac{59}{58}$ as large as each interior angle of $P_2^{}$. What's the largest possible value of $s_{}^{}$?",
  "solutions": {
    "Solution 1": "The formula for the interior angle of a regular sided polygon is $\\frac{(n-2)180}{n}$. \nThus, $\\frac{\\frac{(r-2)180}{r}}{\\frac{(s-2)180}{s}} = \\frac{59}{58}$. Cross multiplying and simplifying, we get $\\frac{58(r-2)}{r} = \\frac{59(s-2)}{s}$. Cross multiply and combine like terms again to yield $58rs - 58 \\cdot 2s = 59rs - 59 \\cdot 2r \\Longrightarrow 118r - 116s = rs$. Solving for $r$, we get $r = \\frac{116s}{118 - s}$.\n$r \\ge 0$ and $s \\ge 0$, making the numerator of the fraction positive. To make the denominator positive, $s < 118$; the largest possible value of $s$ is $117$.\nThis is achievable because the denominator is $1$, making $r$ a positive number $116 \\cdot 117$ and $s = \\boxed{117}$.",
    "Solution 2": "Like above, use the formula for the interior angles of a regular sided polygon.\n\n$\\frac{(r-2)180}{r} = \\frac{59}{58} * \\frac{(s-2)180}{s}$\n\n$59 * 180 * (s-2) * r = 58 * 180 * (r-2) * s$\n\n$59 * (rs - 2r) = 58 * (rs - 2s)$\n\n$rs - 118r = -116s$\n\n$rs = 118r-116s$\n\nThis equation tells us $s$ divides $118r$. If $s$ specifically divides 118 then the highest it can be is 118. However, this gives an equation with no solution. The second largest possibility in this case is $s=59$, which does give a solution: $s=59, r=116$. Although, the problem asks for $s$, not $r$. The only conceivable reasoning behind this is that $r$ is greater than 1000. This prompts us to look into the second case, where $s$ divides $r$. Make $r = s * k$. Rewrite the equation using this new information.\n\n$s * s * k = 118 * s * k - 116 * s$\n\n$s * k = 118 * k - 116$\n\nNow we now k divides 116. The larger k is, the larger s will be, so we set k to be the maximum: 116.\n\n$s * 116 = 118 * 116 - 116$\n\n$s = 118 - 1$\n\n$s = \\boxed{117}$\n",
    "Solution 3": "As in above, we have $rs = 118r - 116s.$ This means that $rs + 116s - 118r = 0.$ Using SFFT we obtain $s(r+116) - 118(r+116) = -118 \\cdot 116 \\implies (s-118)(r+116) = -118 \\cdot 116.$ Since $r+116$ is always positive, we know thta $s-118$ must be negative. Therefore the maximum value of $s$ must be $\\boxed{117}$ which indeed yields an integral value of $r.$"
