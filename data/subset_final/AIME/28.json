    "problem": "Two thousand points are given on a circle. Label one of the points $1$. From this point, count $2$ points in the clockwise direction and label this point $2$. From the point labeled $2$, count $3$ points in the clockwise direction and label this point $3$. (See figure.) Continue this process until the labels $1,2,3\\dots,1993\\,$ are all used. Some of the points on the circle will have more than one label and some points will not have a label. What is the smallest integer that labels the same point as $1993$? \n\n\n \n\n\n ",

        "Solution": "The label $1993$ will occur on the $\\frac12(1993)(1994) \\pmod{2000}$th point around the circle. (Starting from 1) A number $n$ will only occupy the same point on the circle if $\\frac12(n)(n + 1)\\equiv \\frac12(1993)(1994) \\pmod{2000}$. \n\n\n Simplifying this expression, we see that $(1993)(1994) - (n)(n + 1) = (1993 - n)(1994 + n)\\equiv 0\\pmod{2000}$. Therefore, one of $1993 - n$ or $1994 + n$ is odd, and each of them must be a multiple of $125$ or $16$. \n\n\n For $1993 - n$ to be a multiple of $125$ and $1994 + n$ to be a multiple of $16$, $n \\equiv 118 \\pmod {125}$ and $n\\equiv 6 \\pmod {16}$. The smallest $n$ for this case is $118$. \n\n\n In order for $1993 - n$ to be a multiple of $16$ and $1994 + n$ to be a multiple of $125$, $n\\equiv 9\\pmod{16}$ and $n\\equiv 6\\pmod{125}$. The smallest $n$ for this case is larger than $118$, so $\\boxed{118}$ is our answer.\n\n\n  \\textbf{Note:}  One can just substitute $1993\\equiv-7\\pmod{2000}$ and $1994\\equiv-6\\pmod{2000}$ to simplify calculations.\n\n\n ",
        "Solution 2": "Two labels $a$ and $b$ occur on the same point if $\\ a(a+1)/2\\equiv \\ b(b+1)/2\\pmod{2000}$. If we assume the final answer be $n$, then we have $\\frac12(n)(n + 1)\\equiv \\frac12(1993)(1994) \\pmod{2000}$.\n\n\n Multiply $2$ on both side we have $(1993)(1994) - (n)(n + 1) = (1993 - n)(1994 + n)\\equiv 0\\pmod{4000}$. As they have different parities, the even one must be divisible by $32$. As $(1993 - n)+(1994 + n)\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$, one of them is divisible by $5$, which indicates it's divisible by $125$.\n\n\n Which leads to four different cases: $1993-n\\equiv 0\\pmod{4000}$\u00a0; $1994+n\\equiv 0\\pmod{4000}$\u00a0; $1993-n\\equiv 0\\pmod{32}$ and $1994+n\\equiv 0\\pmod{125}$\u00a0; $1993-n\\equiv 0\\pmod{125}$ and $1994+n\\equiv 0\\pmod{32}$. Which leads to $n\\equiv 1993,2006,3881$ and $118\\pmod{4000}$ respectively, and only $n=118$ satisfied.Therefore answer is $\\boxed{118}$.(by ZJY)\n\n\n "
