    "problem": "A solid rectangular block is formed by gluing together $N$  congruent 1-cm  cubes face to face. When the block is viewed so that three of its faces are visible, exactly $231$ of the 1-cm cubes cannot be seen. Find the smallest possible value of $N.$\n\n\n",
    "solutions": {
        "Solution": "The $231$ cubes which are not visible must lie below exactly one layer of cubes.  Thus, they form a rectangular solid which is one unit shorter in each dimension.  If the original block has dimensions $l \\times m \\times n$, we must have $(l - 1)\\times(m-1) \\times(n - 1) = 231$.  The prime factorization of $231 = 3\\cdot7\\cdot11$, so we have a variety of possibilities; for instance, $l - 1 = 1$ and $m - 1 = 11$ and $n - 1 = 3 \\cdot 7$, among others.  However, it should be fairly clear that the way to minimize $l\\cdot m\\cdot n$ is to make $l$ and $m$ and $n$ as close together as possible, which occurs when the smaller block is $3 \\times 7 \\times 11$.  Then the extra layer makes the entire block $4\\times8\\times12$, and $N= \\boxed{384}$.\n\n\nAn alternate way to visualize the problem is to count the blocks that can be seen and subtract the blocks that cannot be seen.  In the given block with dimensions $l\\times m \\times n$, the three faces have $lm$, $mn$, and $ln$ blocks each.  However, $l$ blocks along the first edge, $m$ blocks along the second edge, and $n$ blocks along the third edge were counted twice, so they must be subtracted.  After subtracting these three edges, 1 block has not been counted - it was added three times on each face, but subtracted three times on each side.  Thus, the total number of visible cubes is $lm+mn+ln-l-m-n+1$, and the total number of invisible cubes is $lmn-lm-mn-ln+l+m+n-1$, which can be factored into $(l-1)(m-1)(n-1)$.\n\n\n"
