  "problem": "Let $ABCD$ be an isosceles trapezoid with $\\overline{AD}||\\overline{BC}$ whose angle at the longer base $\\overline{AD}$ is $\\dfrac{\\pi}{3}$. The diagonals have length $10\\sqrt {21}$, and point $E$ is at distances $10\\sqrt {7}$ and $30\\sqrt {7}$ from vertices $A$ and $D$, respectively. Let $F$ be the foot of the altitude  from $C$ to $\\overline{AD}$. The distance $EF$ can be expressed in the form $m\\sqrt {n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m + n$.",

    "Solution 1": "$AD = 20\\sqrt{7}$.\n By the triangle inequality, we can immediately see that $AD \\geq 20\\sqrt{7}$. However, notice that $10\\sqrt{21} = 20\\sqrt{7}\\cdot\\sin\\frac{\\pi}{3}$, so by the law of sines, when $AD = 20\\sqrt{7}$, $\\angle ACD$ is right and the circle centered at $A$ with radius $10\\sqrt{21}$, which we will call $\\omega$, is tangent to $\\overline{CD}$. Thus, if $AD$ were increased, $\\overline{CD}$ would have to be moved even farther outwards from $A$ to maintain the angle of $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and $\\omega$ could not touch it, a contradiction.\n Again, use the triangle inequality to obtain $AD \\geq 20\\sqrt{7}$. Let $x = AD$ and $y = CD$. By the law of cosines on $\\triangle ADC$, $2100 = x^2+y^2-xy \\iff y^2-xy+(x^2-2100) = 0$. Viewing this as a quadratic in $y$, the discriminant $\\Delta$ must satisfy $\\Delta = x^2-4(x^2-2100) = 8400-3x^2 \\geq 0 \\iff x \\leq 20\\sqrt{7}$. Combining these two inequalities yields the desired conclusion.\nThis observation tells us that $E$, $A$, and $D$ are collinear, in that order.\nThen, $\\triangle ADC$ and $\\triangle ACF$ are $30-60-90$ triangles. Hence $AF = 15\\sqrt {7}$, and\nFinally, the answer is $25+7=\\boxed{032}$.",
    "Solution 2": "Extend $\\overline {AB}$ through $B$, to meet $\\overline {DC}$ (extended through $C$) at $G$. $ADG$ is an equilateral triangle because of the angle conditions on the base.\nIf $\\overline {GC} = x$ then $\\overline {CD} = 40\\sqrt{7}-x$, because $\\overline{AD}$ and therefore $\\overline{GD}$ $= 40\\sqrt{7}$.\nBy simple angle chasing, $CFD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle and thus $\\overline{FD} = \\frac{40\\sqrt{7}-x}{2}$, \nand $\\overline{CF} = \\frac{40\\sqrt{21} - \\sqrt{3}x}{2}$\nSimilarly $CAF$ is a 30-60-90 triangle and thus $\\overline{CF} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{21}}{2} = 5\\sqrt{21}$.\nEquating and solving for $x$, $x = 30\\sqrt{7}$ and thus $\\overline{FD} = \\frac{40\\sqrt{7}-x}{2} = 5\\sqrt{7}$.\n$\\overline{ED}-\\overline{FD} = \\overline{EF}$\n$30\\sqrt{7} - 5\\sqrt{7} = 25\\sqrt{7}$ and $25 + 7 = \\boxed{032}$"
